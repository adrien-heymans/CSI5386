If the parties agree that the Target Professional included on such list has (or should have) a primary specialty designation of or otherwise currently practices in the specialty of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then Dova will submit an inquiry to Dova's Third Party Data Source for each such Target Professional, requesting that Dova's Third Party Data Source conduct an investigation to determine the primary specialty designation of each such Target Professional. In addition, if the Parties do not agree, but Valeant, acting reasonably and in good faith, still believes that the Target Professional has (or should have) a primary specialty designation of or otherwise currently practices in the specialty of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then Dova will submit an inquiry to Dova's Third Party Data Source for each such Target Professional, requesting that Dova's Third Party Data Source conduct an investigation to determine the primary specialty designation of each such Target Professional. The Parties shall equally share in the incremental costs to Dova of any such investigations by Dova's Third Party Data Source.

In the event that, following such investigation, Dova's Third Party Data source does not change the primary specialty designation to Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology or, in the case of those Target Professionals with a primary specialty designation of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology and a secondary specialty designation of Hepatology, changes the primary specialty designation to a specialty other than Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then those Target Professionals shall be deemed not to be in the Specialty. For those Target Professionals that were not the subject of an inquiry to or an investigation by Dova's Third Party Data Source, then the specialty designations set out in the original list generated by Dova's Third Party Data Source shall apply for such Calendar Quarter, namely those Target Professionals that have either a\n\nSource: DOVA PHARMACEUTICALS INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nprimary or a secondary specialty designation of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology and that do not have either a primary or a secondary specialty designation of Hepatology shall be deemed to be in the Specialty.\n\n6.5.4 The process described in this Section 6.5 shall be repeated for each Calendar Quarter of the Term; provided, however, that, pursuant to the process described above, if Dova's Third Party Data Source has confirmed that a Target Professional's primary specialty designation should be or should remain Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, it is not necessary for Valeant to seek this confirmation in subsequent Calendar Quarters; provided, further, that, if Dova's Third Party Data Source is subsequently updated (by Dova or any Third Party) to change the specialty designation (primary or secondary) of a Target Professional, pursuant to a request by Dova or a Third Party, then the process described in this Section 6.5 shall be repeated with respect to such Target Professional.\n\nARTICLE 7  AUDIT RIGHTS\n\n7.1 Recordkeeping.

The Party seeking indemnification under Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable (the \"Indemnified Party\") shall give prompt notice to the Party against whom indemnity is sought (the \"Indemnifying Party\") of the assertion or commencement of any Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable, and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to give such notice will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual prejudice thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall assume and control the defense and settlement of any such action, suit or proceeding at its own expense. The Indemnified Party shall, if requested by the Indemnifying Party, cooperate in all reasonable respects in such defense, at the Indemnifying Party's expense. The Indemnified Party will be entitled at its own expense to participate in such defense and to employ separate counsel for such purpose. For so long as the Indemnifying Party is diligently defending any proceeding pursuant to this Section 11.3, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable under Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable, for any settlement effected without its consent. No Party shall enter into any compromise or settlement which commits the other Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action without the other Party's prior written consent (and unless such compromise or settlement includes no payments by the Indemnified Party, an unconditional release of, and no admission of liability by, the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Claim).\n\n11.4 Limitation of Liability.

THE FOREGOING SENTENCE SHALL NOT LIMIT (1) THE OBLIGATIONS OF EITHER PARTY TO INDEMNIFY THE OTHER PARTY FROM AND AGAINST THIRD PARTY CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 11.1 OR 11.2, AS APPLICABLE, OR (2) DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR A PARTY'S BREACH OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-USE OBLIGATIONS IN ARTICLE 9.\n\n11.5 Insurance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that during the Term, it shall maintain, through purchase or self- insurance, adequate insurance, including products liability coverage and comprehensive general liability insurance, adequate to cover its obligations under this Agreement and which are consistent with normal business practices of prudent companies similarly situated. Each Party shall provide reasonable written proof of the existence of such insurance to the other Party upon request. Dova does not and will not maintain or procure any worker's compensation, healthcare, or other insurance for or on behalf of any Field Force Personnel, all of which shall be Valeant's sole responsibility. For clarity, the insurance requirements of this Section 11.5 shall not be construed to create a limit of either Party's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE 11.\n\nARTICLE 12  TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n12.1 Term.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") approved DOPTELET on May 21, 2018 for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. DOPTELET represents the first thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist approved in the United States for this indication.\n\nThrombocytopenia, a condition in which patients have a low platelet count, is the most common hematological abnormality in patients with CLD that often worsens with the severity of liver disease. It is estimated that approximately 15 percent of the 7.5 million patients with CLD have some form of thrombocytopenia. In a study published in 2010, patients with severe thrombocytopenia (<75,000/\u00b5L) had a 31 percent incidence of procedure-related bleeding. As a result of the associated increased rate of bleeding, there is an increased risk for the CLD patient when undergoing common scheduled medical procedures such as liver biopsy, colonoscopy, endoscopy, and routine dental procedures.\n\nAs part of the co-promotion arrangement, Salix intends to deploy approximately 100 sales specialists who will promote DOPTELET to gastroenterology healthcare professionals. The Salix sales force will begin selling DOPTELET in mid-October 2018. Dova will continue its commercial efforts targeting primarily hepatologists and interventional radiologists and certain other specialties. Pursuant to the agreement, Dova will pay Salix a quarterly fee based on net sales (as defined in the agreement) of DOPTELET prescribed by gastroenterologists in the U.S.\n\n\"We are delighted to be working with Salix, a company considered by many to have the preeminent gastroenterology sales force in the United States,\" said Alex C. Sapir, president and chief executive officer, Dova Pharmaceuticals. \"Given Salix's presence and strong reputation within large gastroenterology group practices coupled with the early interest we are seeing among the gastroenterology community, we are excited to see the impact this partnership will bring to DOPTELET and to patients.\"\n\n\"Salix considers liver disease a strategic therapeutic area of focus, given our history and knowledge with XIFAXAN\u00ae (rifaximin), an innovative medicine indicated for the treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a condition that is often a consequence of chronic liver disease,\" said Mark McKenna, president, Salix Pharmaceuticals. \"Adding DOPTELET to our portfolio will enable our sales force to promote yet another innovative product that addresses a true unmet need in the marketplace.\"\n\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

DOPTELET is designed to mimic the effects of TPO, the primary regulator of normal platelet production.\n\nTwo global Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (ADAPT-1 [N=231] and ADAPT-2 [N=204]), conducted in adults with thrombocytopenia (platelet count of less than 50,000/\u00b5L) and CLD, supported the FDA approval. Patients were assigned to either 40 mg or 60 mg of avatrombopag daily for five days based on their Baseline platelet counts (40 to <50,000/\u00b5mL or <40,000/\u00b5mL, respectively). Avatrombopag was shown to be superior to placebo in increasing the proportion of patients not requiring platelet transfusions or rescue procedures for bleeding up to seven days following a scheduled procedure in both trials in both the 40 mg (ADAPT-1, 88% vs. 38%, p <0.0001; ADAPT-2, 88% vs. 33%; p<0.0001), and 60 mg (ADAPT-1, 66% vs. 23%, p <0.0001; ADAPT-2, 69% vs. 35%; p=0.0006) treatment groups. Avatrombopag was also superior to placebo at the two secondary efficacy endpoints in each trial. In the avatrombopag treatment groups, there was an increased proportion of patients achieving the target platelet count of \u226550,000/\u00b5mL on procedure day, and a greater magnitude of the change in mean platelet count from baseline to procedure day; all treatment differences between the avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups for each secondary endpoint were highly statistically significant with p values <0.0001. The most common adverse reactions with avatrombopag included pyrexia, abdominal pain, nausea, headache, fatigue and edema peripheral. Portal vein thromboses have been reported in patients with CLD and in patients receiving TPO receptor agonists. One treatment-emergent event of portal vein thrombosis was reported in the ADAPT trials in an avatrombopag-treated patient.\n\nINDICATION\n\nDOPTELET (avatrombopag) is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\nDOPTELET is a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist and TPO receptor agonists have been associated with thrombotic and thromboembolic complications in patients with chronic liver disease. Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease treated with TPO receptor agonists. In the ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2 clinical trials, there was one treatment- emergent event of portal vein thrombosis in a patient (n=1/430) with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia treated with DOPTELET.\n\nConsider the potential increased thrombotic risk when administering DOPTELET to patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism, including genetic prothrombotic conditions (Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin 20210A, Antithrombin deficiency or Protein C or S deficiency).\n\nDOPTELET should not be administered to patients with chronic liver disease in an attempt to normalize platelet counts.\n\nCONTRAINDICATIONS: None\n\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

It has been proven to reduce the risk of overt HE recurrence and HE-related hospitalizations in adults.\n\n*There is an increased systemic exposure in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when administering XIFAXAN to these patients.\n\nINDICATION  XIFAXAN (rifaximin) 550 mg tablets are indicated for the reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) recurrence in adults and for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) in adults.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\u2022XIFAXAN is not for everyone. Do not take XIFAXAN if you have a known hypersensitivity to rifaximin, any of the rifamycin antimicrobial agents, or any of the components in XIFAXAN.\n\n\u2022If you take antibiotics, like XIFAXAN, there is a chance you could experience diarrhea caused by an overgrowth of bacteria (C. difficile). This can cause symptoms ranging in severity from mild diarrhea to life-threatening colitis. Contact your healthcare provider if your diarrhea does not improve or worsens.\n\n\u2022Talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN if you have severe hepatic (liver) impairment, as this may cause increased effects of the medicine.\n\n\u2022Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking drugs called P-glycoprotein and/or OATPs inhibitors (such as cyclosporine) because using these drugs with XIFAXAN may lead to an increase in the amount of XIFAXAN absorbed by your body.\n\n\u2022In clinical studies, the most common side effects of XIFAXAN were: HE: Peripheral edema (swelling, usually in the ankles or lower limbs), nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), dizziness, fatigue (feeling tired), and ascites (a buildup of fluid in the abdomen)  IBS-D: Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and an increase in liver enzymes\n\n\u2022XIFAXAN may affect warfarin activity when taken together. Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking warfarin because the dose of warfarin may need to be adjusted to maintain proper blood-thinning effect.\n\n\u2022If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or nursing, talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN because XIFAXAN may cause harm to an unborn baby or nursing infant. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800- FDA-1088.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

Immediately upon notification from PPI, such post termination  sales shall cease.   17.4 Other Remedies of EKR. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event that EKR is entitled to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 16.1(a), in addition to the right to terminate as provided therein and any other remedies EKR  may have hereunder, PPI shall assist EKR in the transfer of the manufacture of the Products, including the Specifications from PPI to EKR  or EKR's designee. In such event, the Royalty payments payable hereunder shall continue to be paid; provided,  however, that all costs  incurred by EKR in the transfer of manufacturing information from PPI and obtaining FDA approval of the manufacture of the Products by  EKR or EKR's designee, and any other amounts due to EKR, shall be deducted from any royalties payable to PPI. In addition, PPI shall  during the remainder of the Term and for a period of up to [**] ([**]) years thereafter continue to manufacture and supply the Product to  EKR at cost without mark-up until such time that EKR can secure an FDA approved manufacturing facility for the Product. PPI shall provide such advice as necessary for EKR to arrange for an alternative manufacturer and shall provide EKR with access to all relevant PPI  Know-How, and any other information necessary for EKR to transfer such manufacturing to an alternate manufacturer. In addition, (i) PPI  shall transfer to EKR any Marketing Authorizations held by PPI and (ii) the Trademark license granted under Section 2.3 shall continue in  effect following such termination on a perpetual basis and EKR shall be responsible for all costs associated with the maintenance of such  Trademark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -58-\n\n17.5 EKR Step-In Rights.\n\n\n\n(a) During the Term, in the event EKR has the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 16.1(a) - (i) hereof (the \"Step-in  Right Trigger Event\"), and EKR does not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement under such Section, EKR shall  have the option to exercise step-in rights to manufacture the Product for the remainder of the Term (the \"Step-in Right\") by  providing PPI written notice of such election within ninety (90) days after the Step-in Right Trigger Event (or such longer  period as mutually agreed by the Parties) (the \"Step-in Right Notice\"); provided that in the event such Step-in Right  Trigger Event has been cured prior to EKR's exercise of the Step-in Right, the Step-in Right shall terminate with respect to  such Step-in Right Trigger Event. The Step-in Right Notice shall specify the date which EKR intends to exercise the rights  associated with the Step-in Right.\n\n  (b) In the event EKR exercises the Step-in Right, PPI shall, at EKR's cost and expense, cooperate in the exercise of such rights  and EKR shall reimburse PPI for the reasonable costs PPI incurs in assisting EKR in the exercise of such rights within thirty  (30) days of EKR's receipt of invoice.\n\n\n\n(c) The Step-in Right shall include, without limitation, and to the extent allowable under Applicable Law, PPI's grant to EKR of  such additional license rights, rights of access, rights of observation and rights of management, direction and control, in  each case solely with respect to the manufacture and supply of Product and as reasonably necessary to enable and permit  EKR (or EKR's designee) to ensure that the supply of Product shall continue to be available to EKR under this Agreement  and the Supply Agreement; provided that EKR in exercising the Step-in Right shall not (i) unreasonably interfere with PPI's  other activities at the facilities at which the Product is manufactured, tested, labeled, stored or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -59-\n\n\n\notherwise handled (\"Product Facilities\") or (ii) require PPI to take any action or fail to take any action that does or could  reasonably be expected to interfere with PPI's other activities at the Product Facilities. The foregoing rights shall apply  with respect to any Product Facility to the extent necessary for EKR to preserve and protect supply of the Product as  contemplated by this Agreement and the Supply Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) upon termination of the Lease  Term, PPI shall maintain responsibility and control over all other products manufactured by PPI and nothing in this Section  17.5 shall give EKR any rights to direct, manage or control the manufacture of such products (ii) PPI shall maintain  responsibility and control over the facilities where Product is manufactured, tested, labeled, stored or otherwise handled  and nothing in this Section 17.5 shall give EKR general oversight or control of the facilities where Product is manufactured,  tested, labeled, stored or otherwise handled.\n\n  (d) In the event EKR exercises the Step-in Right, EKR shall comply with all policies applicable to the facilities where Product is  manufactured, tested, labeled, stored or otherwise handled and all Applicable Laws with respect to the manufacture of the  Product.\n\n18. Force Majeure   18.1 Obligation to Perform. Except for payment obligations which shall not be excused or affected by any Force Majeure, neither Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement or shall be liable to the other under this Agreement for loss or damages attributable to any Force  Majeure, provided the Party affected shall give prompt notice thereof to the other Party. Subject to Section 18.2, the Party giving such  notice shall be excused from such of its obligations hereunder for so long as it continues to be affected by Force Majeure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -60-\n\n18.2 Duration. If such Force Majeure continues unabated for a period of at least ninety (90) days, the Parties will meet to discuss in good faith  what actions to take or what modifications should be made to this Agreement as a consequence of such Force Majeure in order to alleviate  its consequences on the affected Party. If the affected Party is prevented by reason of any circumstances referred to in this Section of this  Agreement from performing any of its obligations hereunder for a continuous period of six (6) months the other Party may terminate this  Agreement.\n\n19.

Subject to Section 20.2, neither Party shall, nor shall it purport to, assign, license, transfer or change any of its rights or  obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld  conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 20.4 either Party may assign its rights hereunder to an  Affiliate or to any successor by merger, consolidation, sale of stock or other equity interests or the sale of substantially all of the assets of  such Party without the consent of the other Party. For the avoidance of doubt, either Party may grant a security interest with respect to its  rights under this Agreement in connection with a secured financing or similar transaction.   20.2 Sub-Distribution. EKR may appoint sub-distributors under this Agreement provided that EKR:\n\n  (a) informs PPI of the identity of any Third Party sub-distributor (other than Affiliate companies) prior to the execution of any  sub-distribution agreement;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -62-\n\n  (b) obtain a confidential nondisclosure agreement with the prospective Sub-Distributor in a form acceptable to PPI, which  acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and containing terms at least as stringent as those terms  included in Article 11 of this Agreement;\n\n  (c) deliver to the prospective Sub-Distributor a redacted copy of this Agreement (\"Redacted Agreement\") .  Any sub- distribution agreement shall provide that such agreement is subject and subordinate to the rights of PPI under this  Agreement; and\n\n  (d) provides PPI with a copy of written sub-distribution agreement as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution  thereof by EKR.   20.3 Responsibility of EKR. Notwithstanding any such sub-distribution agreement, EKR shall remain primarily liable to PPI for its obligations hereunder, and for any act or omission of any sub-distributor.   20.4 Change of Control. Should there be a Change of Control of either Party resulting in the control of such Party by a Third Party which  markets or sells a Competing Product in any part of the Territory, then the rights under this Agreement may not be assigned without the  express consent of the other Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. \"Change of Control\" shall mean (a) the sale, lease,  exchange, license or disposition of all or substantially all of the Party's assets in one transaction or series of related transactions or (b) a  merger or consolidation with an unaffiliated Third Party as a result of which the holders of the Party's issued and outstanding voting  securities immediately before such transaction own or control less than a majority of the voting securities of the continuing or surviving  entity immediately after such transaction. The issuance by either Party of securities in connection with any financing transaction or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   -63-\n\n\n\npublic offering shall not be deemed a Change of Control under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purposes of Section  6.3(b)(iii): (i) references to a \"Party\" in the above definition of Change of Control shall be deemed to include PPI as well as any Affiliate of  PPI and (ii) a Change of Control shall also include (in addition to any of the transactions described above in the definition of Change of  Control), any sale of securities of PPI or its Affiliates directly by the holder (the \"Holder\") of such securities (other than to an Affiliate of  such Holder) in which such sale results in a transfer of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of PPI or its Affiliates.\n\n21.

Unless expressly agreed, no waiver of any term, provision or condition of this Agreement shall constitute a general waiver of any provisions of this Agreement, nor shall it affect any rights, obligations or liabilities under or pursuant to this Agreement which have  already accrued up to the date of variation, and the rights and obligations of the Parties under or pursuant to this Agreement shall remain in  full force and effect, except and only to the extent that they are so waived.   21.8 Unenforceability. If and to the extent that any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, void or unenforceable, such provision shall  be given no effect and shall be deemed not to be included in this Agreement but without invalidating any of the remaining provisions of  this Agreement.   21.9 Delay. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right or remedy provided by law under or pursuant to this Agreement shall  impair such right or remedy or operate or be construed as a waiver or variation of it or preclude its exercise at any subsequent time and no  single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise of it or the exercise of any other right or  remedy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(signature page follows)      -65-\n\n21.10 Cumulative Rights.

It is the only extended-release opioid that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for epidural use. A single  injection of DepoDur into the lumbar epidural space may provide pain relief for up to 48 hours following major surgery without the restrictions and  potential complications associated with an indwelling epidural catheter.\n\n\"The product characteristics of DepoDur fit exceptionally well with EKR's acquisition model,\" said Howard Weisman, EKR's Chairman & CEO.  \"DepoDur is patent protected, addresses an important medical need in our market space, and has growth prospects that can be fully exploited through the application of EKR's expertise and strengths in the acute care market.\"\n\nMr. Weisman further noted, \"EKR is commencing a number of pre-launch activities, including interacting with opinion leaders, and we expect to  fully deploy our sales force in support of DepoDur early next year.\" He concluded, \"We are very optimistic about EKR's growth prospects in 2008  as we foresee a ramp up in sales for both DepoDur and Gelclair\u00ae and anticipate favorable market synergies between these products.\" Gelclair,  which is marketed to acute care facilities and cancer centers, is indicated for the management of pain associated with oral lesions of various  etiologies, including chemotherapy and radiation induced oral mucositis/stomatitis.\n\nTong Zhang, Ph.D., Director of Business Development for EKR, added, \"Acquiring the rights to DepoDur exemplifies EKR's strategy of focusing  on building a portfolio of premier products in the acute care space.\"  He further noted, \"Our strict acquisition criteria center on high-margin,  innovative products that offer value to healthcare providers and their patients, thus, representing excellent opportunities for EKR to realize strong  returns on investment.\"      -73-\n\n\n\n  SCHEDULE VI\n\n  PRESS RELEASE\n\n\u00ae\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pacira Pharmaceuticals is delighted to have EKR Therapeutics as our marketing and commercialization partner for DepoDur in the Americas,\"  commented Fred Middleton, Pacira's Chairman of the Board. \"This product was clinically developed as a proprietary treatment by Pacira R&D and  it received FDA approval in 2004 for long-acting post surgical pain management, for which it is known to be effective.\"\n\nMr. Middleton further noted, \"EKR Therapeutics has demonstrated in the past that they possess the strengths to successfully bringing a focused  marketing and clinician targeting approach to DepoDur to help it reach its full commercial potential. We look forward to working with EKR, as our  partner on the expanded commercial marketing of DepoDur.\"\n\nDetailed terms of the transaction were not disclosed. However, EKR did note that in addition to royalty payments on net sales, it has agreed to an  upfront payment amounting to somewhat more than [**] times DepoDur's 2006 U.S. sales.

You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.\n\nMEMBERSHIP.

Otherwise, dividends will be applied under the Payment of Premium option unless the Cash option has been chosen in writing.\n\nCash. Dividends are paid in cash.\n\nPayment of Premium.

For purposes of this Agreement,           the \"CNET Sites\" refer to any Internet sites operated by CNET or its           subsidiaries, including without limitation the sites referenced in           Section 2.5 and Exhibit A.\n\n2.   CNET's Obligations.\n\n     2.1  TV Promotions. CNET will provide the Company one 15 second \"spot\" for           Promotions on its syndicated weekly TV program, TV.COM. Promotions           will run on each weekly episode of TV.COM during the Term; provided           that TV.COM remains on the air throughout such period. Should TV.COM           not be run on the air during a portion of the Term, CNET will run two           download.com banner advertising programs per month during such portion           of the Term in lieu of the foregoing TV.COM Promotions.\n\n     2.2  Banner Promotions. CNET will provide advertising banners to the           Company during the Term as described in Exhibit A.\n\n     2.3  Retail Promotions.\n\n            2.3.1  CNET will provide for various retail Promotions across the CNET                  Sites, which may include text/HTML links, buttons, portals and                  other fixed Promotions that include embedded links to the                  Company Site (the \"Retail Promotions\" and, together with the                  advertising banners contemplated in the preceding paragraph,                  the \"Online Promotions\").\n\n          2.3.2  Subject to Section 4 below, CNET will provide the Company with                  a total of at least (a) [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during                  the first three months of the Term, (b) [XXXXXX] Retail                  Impressions during the second three months of the Term, (c)                  [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during the third three months                  of the Term, and (d) [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during                  the fourth three months of the Term. For such purposes, a                  \"Retail Impression\" means the display of one page of a CNET                  Site that contains at least one Retail Promotion. If CNET fails                  to provide the Retail Impressions required by the preceding                  sentence during the Term, then CNET will continue to display                  Retail Impressions in accordance with this Agreement following                  the Term (notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the                  Term) until the required number of Retail Impressions has been                  delivered.\n\n     2.4  Placement of Retail Promotions. CNET will determine the location and           type of each Retail Promotion displayed throughout the CNET Sites and           may phase in certain types of Retail Promotions as they are developed.           CNET currently intends to display Retail Promotions consisting of           text/HTML links, pre-filled with an appropriate query string or link           (\"Pre-Filled Links\"), as set forth in this Section. The Retail           Promotions contemplated by this Section will be displayed above the           fold where the graphical layout of the page reasonably permits such           positioning (as determined by CNET), and in other cases the Retail           Promotions will be prominently positioned below the fold. For the           purposes of clarity, the \"fold\" is defined as the visible portion of           the screen on a standard 640 x 480 screen size.\n\n          2.4.1  On SEARCH.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on the\n\n\n\n\n\n                 search query page related to Shopping and on every search                  results page served by CNET.\n\n          2.4.2  On CNET.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on pages                  within the site except the Front Door and except for pages                  within the Personalities and Community sections.\n\n          2.4.3  On BUILDER.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on                  pages within the site except the Front Door and the \"Builder                  Buzz\" section.\n\n            2.4.4  On GAMECENTER.COM, NEWS.COM, DOWNLOAD.COM and SHAREWARE.COM,                  CNET will display a Pre-Filled Link on pages within the site                  except the Front Door.\n\n          2.4.5  Other pages of the CNET Sites, CNET will display additional                  Retail Promotions as appropriate and as mutually agreed upon.\n\n     2.5  Design and Production of Online Promotions. The Company will design           any graphics required for the Online Promotions and provide pre-filled           query strings or links for all of the Pre-Filled Links, with           reasonable assistance from CNET, and the Company will supply digital           copies of such graphics and other materials to CNET. CNET will be           responsible for incorporating the Online Promotions into the CNET           Sites and for ensuring that the Online Promotions are accessible to           users of the CNET Sites (\"Users\").\n\n     2.6  Reporting. Within 30 days after the end of each month during the Term,           CNET will provide a report to the Company indicating the number of           Retail Promotions displayed on the CNET Sites during such month and           the number of times that a User clicked on a Retail Promotion during           such month. CNET will also provide standard reporting for banner           advertisements and television Promotions.\n\n3.   The Company's Obligations:\n\n     3.1  Operation of Company Site. The Company will be responsible for           ensuring that each link embedded within an Online Promotion takes the           User to the appropriate area within the Company Site, and that the           Company Site functions with reasonable reliability and in a           commercially reasonable manner throughout the Term. In particular, the           Company agrees that the Company Site will comply with the performance           standards set forth in Exhibit B throughout the Term. Any failure by           the Company to comply with this paragraph will be deemed to be a           material breach of this Agreement.\n\n     3.2  Reporting. Within 30 days after the end of each month during the Term,           the Company will provide a report to CNET indicating the aggregate           number of referrals from the CNET Sites to the Company Site during           such month, the resulting number of buyers, the aggregate behavior           (including orders and sales volume) of those buyers, and the total           revenue attributable to the Online Promotions minus applicable sales           tax, shipping costs, returns and cancellations (the \"CNET Sales\"). The           \"CNET Sales\" will be counted as sales by the Company to each User who           accesses the Company Site through a link from an Online Promotion for           a period of 4 hours from the referral, CNET and The Company will agree           on technical procedures to allow the easy and accurate reporting of           CNET Sales. The Company will make this information available in a           manner which\n\n            allows CNET and the Company to understand the performance of the           various Online Promotions.\n\n     3.3  Cash Consideration.\n\n          3.3.1  For each month during the Term, the Company will pay CNET a                  minimum of [XXXX] in cash, plus [XXX] of CNET Sales. Payments                  under this paragraph will be based on the reports prepared by                  the Company under Section 3.2 (although CNET may challenge such                  reports as contemplated by Section 9.5) and will be due within                  30 days after the end of each month of the Term.\n\n          3.3.2  Payments under this Section 3.3 will be made by wire transfer                  of immediately available funds and are nonrefundable once paid.\n\n     3.4  User Information. At least once each calendar quarter, the Company           will deliver to CNET all aggregate data collected as a result of the           CNET Sales, including but not limited to, demographic data, buying           behavior as measured by conversion to sale, frequency of purchasing,           average order size, and a comparison to the respective average for the           Company.\n\n     3.5  Reciprocal Marketing. For the duration of the Term, the Company will           place a link within the Beta Report Newsletter, the Cyberian Express           Newsletter, the Gamer's Express newsletter, or any newsletter to which           users can subscribe to which is provided by the Company to its users           (expressly excluded from this obligation are emails that are sent by           the Company for product announcements, or personalized emails sent to           users upon product purchase. This link will be a text phrase or series           of text phrases encouraging the users to sign up for CNET's free email           newsletters for technology News, CNET Dispatch, and Software &           Hardware Services. CNET will provide all entry forms and operate the           production and sending of the newsletter. CNET agrees not to           specifically target these subscribers separately from the general\n\n\n\n\n\n          database of subscribers to CNET's various newsletters. Should the           Company provide a persistent link or series of links (as distinguished           from occasional and ad hoc links to product reviews either on the           Company Site or in any communication by the Company to its customers)           to a \"Technology Content Provider\", CNET shall be given at least equal           prominence to any other Technology Content Provider provided that CNET           offers comparable editorial content. A Technology Content Provider is           defined as a company providing news product information or reviews           about technology products that is not a manufacturer of those           products.\n\n4.   Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement (the \"Term\") will begin on      February 1, 1998 and end on the first anniversary of the date of this      Agreement; provided that (a) either party may terminate this Agreement,      effective at any time after the first three\n\n       months of the Term, by giving 30 days' written notice of termination to the      other party, and (b) either party may terminate this Agreement at any time      by giving written notice of termination to the other party, if the other      party commits a material breach of its obligations hereunder that is not      cured within 30 days after notice thereof from the non-breaching party. If      this Agreement is terminated during any of the three month periods      referenced in Section 2.3.2, then the required number of Retail Impressions      applicable thereunder to such three month period will be pro rated      accordingly.\n\n5.   Exclusivity. For purposes of this agreement \"Competing Computer Products      Retailer\" means any company other than the Company that is engaged in the      retail sale of computer products, with the exception of CNET Direct, which      operates BuyDirect.com. During the Term, CNET will not enter into more than      two other agreements under which CNET receives consideration from a      Competing Computer Products Retailer for displaying permanent links to or      other fixed promotions for such Competing Computer Products Retailer on any      CNET Site; provided that the foregoing will not restrict the display of(a)      standard advertisements for any Competing Computer Products Retailer or its      products or (b) any promotions within COMPUTERS.COM or within CNET's Snap!      Online service (which are expressly excluded from this provision). The      parties acknowledge that the foregoing will not prevent CNET from      displaying text links and other references to Competing Computer Products      Retailers as reasonably necessary to provide appropriate editorial and      search related services on the CNET Sites. The Retail Promotions granted to      the Company shall be placed in such a way as to provide no more or less      prominence to the Company than is provided to any other Competing Computer      Retailer signing an agreement with CNET.\n\n6.  Trademark Licenses.\n\n     6.1  The Company hereby grants to CNET a non-exclusive, royalty-free           license, effective throughout the Term, to use, display and publish           any of the Company trademarks, tradenames, service marks and logos           that may be delivered by the Company to CNET expressly for inclusion           in the Promotions, solely for use in connection with the Promotions.           Any use of the Company Marks by CNET must comply with any reasonable           usage guidelines communicated by the Company to CNET from time to           time. Nothing contained in this Agreement will give CNET any right,           title or interest in or to the Company Marks or the goodwill           associated therewith, except for the limited usage rights expressly           provided above. CNET acknowledges and agrees that, as between the           Company and CNET, the Company is the sole owner of all rights in and           to the Company Marks.\n\n     6.2  The Company hereby represents and warrants to CNET that the Company           has, and will have throughout the Term, all necessary rights in and to           the Company Marks to grant CNET the licenses and usage rights           contemplated by this Agreement without violating the rights of any           third party.\n\n  7.   Responsibility for the Company Products. The Company acknowledges and      agrees that, as between the Company and CNET, the Company will be solely      responsible for any claims or other losses associated with or resulting      from the marketing or operation of the Company Site or the offer or sale of      any Products by the Company or through the Company Site. CNET is not      authorized to make, and agrees not to make, any representations or      warranties concerning the Products, except to the extent (if any) contained      within Promotions delivered to CNET by the Company.\n\n8.   Mutual Indemnification.\n\n     8.1  Indemnification by CNET. CNET shall indemnify and hold the Company           harmless from and against any costs, losses, liabilities and expenses,           including all court costs, reasonable expenses and reasonable           attorney's fees (collectively, \"Losses\") that the Company may suffer,           incur or be subjected to by reason of any legal action, proceeding,           arbitration or other claim by a third party, whether commenced or           threatened, arising out of or as a result of (a) any breach or alleged           breach by CNET of its representations, warranties or covenants           hereunder; or (b) the operation of the CNET Sites (except in cases           where the Company is required to indemnify CNET under the following           paragraph), including claims of infringement or misappropriation of           intellectual property rights.\n\n     8.2  Indemnification by the Company. The Company shall indemnify and hold           CNET harmless from and against any Losses that CNET may suffer, incur           or be subjected to by reason of any legal action, proceeding,\n\n\n\n\n\n          arbitration or other claim by a third party, whether commenced or           threatened, arising out of or as a result of (a) any breach or alleged           breach by the Company of its representations, warranties or covenants           hereunder; (b) the use by CNET of the Company Marks or any content           provided by the Company to CNET expressly for display in connection           with or as part of the Promotions, including claims of infringement or           misappropriation of intellectual property rights; or (c) the operation           of the Company Site or the offer or sale of the Products by the           Company or through the Company Site.\n\n     8.3  Indemnification Procedures. If any party entitled to indemnification           under this section (an \"Indemnified Party\") makes an indemnification           request to the other, the Indemnified Party shall permit the other           party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") to control the defense, disposition           or settlement of the matter at its own expense; provided that the           Indemnifying Party shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified           Party enter into any settlement or agree to any disposition that           imposes an obligation on the Indemnified Party that is not wholly           discharged or dischargeable by the Indemnifying Party, or imposes any           conditions or obligations on the Indemnified Party other than the           payment of monies that are readily measurable for purposes of           determining the monetary indemnification or reimbursement obligations           of Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall\n\n            notify Indemnifying Party promptly of any claim for which Indemnifying           Party is responsible and shall cooperate with Indemnifying Party in           every commercially reasonable way to facilitate defense of any such           claim; provided that the Indemnified Party's failure to notify           Indemnifying Party shall not diminish Indemnifying Party's obligations           under this Section except to the extent that Indemnifying Party is           materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. An Indemnified           Party shall at all times have the option to participate in any matter           or litigation through counsel of its own selection and at its own           expense.\n\n9.   Miscellaneous.\n\n     9.1  LIMITATION OF DAMAGES. NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,           INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR           RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF           LIABILITY (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), AND EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN           ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n     9.2  Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party, except           (a) to the transferee of substantially all of the business operations           of such party (whether by asset sale, stock sale, merger or otherwise)           or (b) to any entity that controls, is controlled by or is under           common control with such party.\n\n     9.3  Relationship of Parties. This Agreement will not be construed to           create a joint venture, partnership or the relationship of principal           and agent between the parties hereto, nor to impose upon either party           any obligations for any losses, debts or other obligations incurred by           the other party except as expressly set forth herein.\n\n     9.4  Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes and contains the entire           agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter           hereof and supersedes any prior oral or written agreements.

Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other has not made any           representations, warranties or agreements of any kind, except as           expressly set forth herein.\n\n     9.5  Audit Rights. Each party will have the right to engage an independent           third party to audit the books and records of the other party relevant           to the calculation of Retail Impressions or CNET Sales, upon           reasonable notice and during normal business hours, and the other           party will provide reasonable cooperation in connection with any such           audit. The party requesting the audit will pay all expenses of the           auditor unless the audit reveals an underpayment by the other party of           more than 5%, in which case the other party will reimburse all           reasonable expenses of the auditor.\n\n       9.6  Applicable Law.  This Agreement will be construed in accordance with           and governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to           principles of  conflicts of law.\n\n     9.7.

NON-CIRCUMVENTION     9.1 W2E agrees not to engage in business dealings, discussions, or otherwise work directly with any third parties introduced to W2E  through SHBV, or to exploit any pre-existing relationship of SHBV with any third party that has been represented to W2E by SHBV,  without the prior consent and/or direct participation of SHBV.     9.2 SHBV agrees not to engage in business dealings, discussions, or otherwise work directly with any third parties introduced to SHBV  through W2E, or to exploit any pre-existing relationship of W2E with any third party that has been represented to SHBV by W2E,  without the prior consent and/or direct participation of W2E.     8\n\n\n\n\n\n     10.

For the sake of certainty, the  licence created by this Agreement does not extend to the use of the other Party's Intellectual Property Rights for any other commercial  purpose.     10.3 The licence granted in Clause 10.2 above will automatically expire at the end of the Term of this Agreement.     10.4 Each Party shall indemnify and keep indemnified the other Party against all costs, claims, losses, expenses and damages incurred by the other  Party as a result of any breach of the provisions set out in this Clause 10 or arising directly or indirectly out of any infringement by that  Party of the other Party's Intellectual Property Rights.     11. CONFIDENTIALITY     11.1 For purposes of this Clause:     Authorised Persons means the directors, employees, officers, professional advisers, agents and contractors of each Party;     Confidential Information means all information in any medium or format (written, oral, visual or electronic, and whether or not marked or  described as \"confidential\"), together with Copies, which relates to a Party (the \"Disclosing Party\"), to its Group, or to its (or its Group  members') employees, officers, customers or suppliers, and which is directly or indirectly disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the other  Party (the \"Recipient Party\") in the course of its dealings relating to this Agreement, before or after the date of this Agreement. However,  the following information is not \"Confidential Information\" for the purposes of this Agreement:     (i) information which is in the public domain other than as a result of breach of this Agreement or any separate confidentiality undertaking between  the Parties;     (ii) information which the Recipient Party received, free of any obligation of confidence, from a third party which itself was not under any  obligation of confidence in relation to that information; and     9\n\n\n\n\n\n     (iii) information which was developed or created independently by or on behalf of the Recipient Party or any member of the Recipient  Party's Group; and     Copies means all reproductions (hard copy or electronic), extracts, summaries or analyses of Confidential Information in any medium or  format made by or on behalf of any Party.     11.2 In return for the disclosure by each Party of Confidential Information and for other consideration given under this Agreement, each Party shall  (except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or with the written consent of the Disclosing Party);     11.2.1 keep all Confidential Information secret;     11.2.2 only use or make Copies of Confidential Information in connection with and to the extent necessary for the purposes of this Agreement;     11.2.3 take all reasonable action to ensure that, within its organisation, the Confidential Information is not made available to any person who is not  an Authorised Person;     11.2.4 use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that Confidential Information within its control is kept securely protected against theft or  unauthorised access, and in any event shall maintain its security, integrity and confidentiality to at least the same standard as it applies to  its own confidential information; and     11.2.5 not reverse engineer, or attempt to reverse engineer, any software comprised within the Confidential Information, except to the extent  permitted by law.     11.3 A Party may disclose Confidential Information to any Authorised Persons on a \"need-to-know\" basis solely in relation to the Agreement,  provided that that Party:     11.3.1 informs all Authorised Persons that the Confidential Information is confidential; and     11.3.2 ensures that all Authorised Persons (other than those already under a professional duty of confidence to that Party or an obligation of  confidence as part of employment arrangements) enter into written confidentiality undertakings with it on equivalent terms to this Clause,  and provides copies of such undertakings to the other Party to this Agreement upon that other Party's reasonable request; and     11.3.3 shall be responsible for all acts and omissions of Authorised Persons as though they were its own acts or omissions under this Agreement.     11.4 Either Party may disclose Confidential Information to a third party, provided that before any such disclosure the express written consent of the  other Party has been received in writing and signed by a duly authorised signatory. Such consent lies in the entire discretion of the Party  owning the Confidential Information and     10\n\n\n\n\n\n     without prejudice to that, the Party's consent may be conditional upon the third party entering into a confidentiality or non-disclosure  agreement with the owner of the Confidential Information prior to any disclosure being made.     11.5 Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party if it becomes aware of any unauthorised use or disclosure by any Authorised Person or any  other person of any Confidential Information.     11.6 A Party may disclose any Confidential Information to any regulator, law enforcement agency or other third party if it is required to do so by  law, regulation, or similar authority. In those circumstances:     11.6.1 that Party shall (provided that it is practical and lawful to do so) notify the other Party in writing as soon as practicable before the disclosure;     11.6.2 the Parties shall use all reasonable endeavours to consult with each other with a view to agreeing the timing, manner and extent of the  disclosure; and     11.6.3 the Party required to disclose shall in any event use all reasonable endeavours to obtain written confidentiality undertakings in its favour  from the third party.     11.7 If the Party required to disclose is unable to inform the Disclosing Party before Confidential Information is disclosed, it shall (provided that it is  lawful to do so) fully inform the Disclosing Party immediately afterwards in writing of the circumstances of the disclosure and the  Confidential Information which has been disclosed.     11.8 Nothing in this Agreement or the disclosures envisaged by this Clause shall (except as expressly agreed otherwise) operate to transfer any  Intellectual Property Rights in the Confidential Information.     11.9 The undertakings and other provisions of this Clause shall continue in force without limit in time and shall survive termination of this  Agreement, but shall cease to apply to information which may enter the public domain otherwise than through the unauthorised  disclosure by or fault of the recipient of the Confidential Information or by a person with whom such recipient is connected in any way.     11.10 Each Party acknowledges that damages alone would not be an adequate remedy in the event of breach by the other Party of the provisions of  this Clause. Accordingly, it is agreed that either Party shall be entitled, without proof of special damages, to seek an injunction or other  interim remedy for any threatened or actual breach of this Clause, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies which that Party may have.     12. PUBLICITY     12.1 The Parties shall cooperate in any public relations or publicity exercises pertaining to the Alliance, and agree to share with each other and  coordinate the content and     11\n\n\n\n\n\n     timing of press releases, prior to submission of such information for public release.

INDEMNITIES     14.1  Each Party agrees to indemnify, hold and save harmless the other Party, and defend at its own expense, from and against all suits, claims,  demands and liability of any nature and kind, including their cost and expenses, arising from:     14.1.1 the negligence; or     14.1.2 any intentionally wrongful acts or omissions, of the Party's own employees, agents, affiliates or subcontractors in connection with this  Agreement.     15.

Customer agrees, as reasonably requested by eGain, to provide eGain with access to Customer's premises and equipment and to otherwise cooperate with eGain in performing the services. During the term of this Agreement, Customer may obtain information (\"Reports\") regarding Customer's use of the Software and the quantity and handling of Online Messages routed to the eGain System by accessing the eGain System through a password-protected Web site made available by eGain. Customer shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of such passwords and shall permit only authorized employees of Customer to access the eGain System. The Hosting Services, and the hosting fees specified in Exhibit A, do not include any deployment, training or other consulting or professional services which, if applicable, will be specified in a Statement of Work, signed by both parties, and incorporated herein by this reference.\n\n2.1 Customer Support. eGain will provide live telephone support to Customer 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week by a trained eGain customer support representative.\n\n3. Customer's Responsibilities. Customer agrees that it shall be responsible for providing and maintaining its own Internet access and all necessary telecommunications equipment, software and other materials (\"Customer Equipment\") at Customer's location necessary for accessing the Software and the eGain System through the Internet. Customer agrees to notify eGain of any changes in the Customer Equipment, including any system configuration changes or any hardware or software upgrades, which may affect the Hosting Services provided hereunder.

All prices are stated, and Customer shall pay, in United States dollars. Payment received by eGain after the due date shall be subject to a late fee equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or, if less, the maximum amount allowed by applicable law. At the end of the initial one-year term of this Agreement and any subsequent one-year terms, eGain may adjust the monthly fee payable under this Agreement by providing Customer written notice of such adjustment at least sixty (60) days prior to the beginning of the new term.\n\n6. Limited Warranties; Disclaimer of Warranties.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1 eGain warrants and represents to Customer that (i) the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation, if any, provided by eGain to Customer, and (ii) the Hosting Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner and in accordance with Section 2. In the event of Downtime (as defined in this Section 6.1 below), as Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and eGain's sole and exclusive liability, the monthly fee payable for the Hosting Services shall be reduced as follows:\n\na) For the first sixty (60) minutes of Downtime during Normal Business       Hours or the first four (4) hours of Downtime outside of Normal Business       Hours (\"Initial Downtime\"), eGain will credit Customer's account for one       (1) day of service.\n\nb) For each eight (8) hour period of Downtime per day in addition to the       Initial Downtime, eGain will credit Customer's account for one (1)       additional day of service.\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, \"Downtime\" shall mean any interruption in the availability of Hosting Services to Customer (excluding scheduled interruptions of which Customer is notified 48 hours in advanced), only if such interruption is due either to: 1) an error in the Software, or 2) failure of the eGain System (but not including problems associated with Internet connectivity). Downtime begins upon Customer notification to eGain of the interruption, either\n\neGAIN COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION\n\nHOSTING AGREEMENT\n\nby speaking directly with an eGain customer service representative or recording a voice mail message in the eGain customer service voice mail box, and continues until the availability of the Hosting Services is restored to the Customer. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Normal Business Hours\" shall mean between the hours of 6:00 a.m to 6:00 p.m. Pacific time, Monday through Friday excluding national holidays.\n\nIn the event of a breach (other than Downtime) of the warranty set forth in Section 6.1(i) above, Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and eGain's sole and exclusive liability shall be, at eGain's option, repair or replacement of the Software.\n\nTHE FOREGOING CONSTITUTES CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AND eGAIN'S ENTIRE LIABILITY, FOR DOWNTIME AND FOR BREACH OF THE HOSTING SERVICES WARRANTY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 6.1.\n\n6.2 eGain represents and warrants that, prior to, during and after the calendar year 2000 A.D., the Software and the eGain System will process, calculate, manipulate, sort, store and transfer date data without material error or material performance degradation, including without limitation date data which represents or references different centuries or more than one century (such representation and warranty being referred to as \"Year 2000 Compliant\"). In the event that the Software or eGain System is not Year 2000 Compliant, Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and eGain's sole and exclusive liability shall be for eGain, at no additional cost to Customer, to promptly modify the Software or the eGain System so that the Software or eGain System is Year 2000 Compliant. The foregoing warranty is conditioned upon the Customer using the Software and/or the eGain System in accordance with its applicable Documentation, and on other software, hardware, network and systems (other than the Software and the eGain System) with which the Software and/or the eGain System interface or interoperate also being Year 2000 Compliant.\n\n6.3 EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 6.1-6.2, (A) THE HOSTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED, AND THE SOFTWARE AND THE eGAIN SYSTEM ARE MADE AVAILABLE, BY eGAIN TO CUSTOMER \"AS IS,\" AND (B) eGAIN AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE HOSTING SERVICES, THE SOFTWARE OR THE eGAIN SYSTEM, AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE BY LAW.\n\n6.4 Without limiting the express warranties set forth in this Agreement, eGain does not warrant that the Software, the eGain System or the Hosting Services will meet Customer's requirements (except as provided in Section 6.1) or that Customer's access to and use of the Software, the eGain System or the Hosting Services will be uninterrupted or free of errors or omissions. eGain cannot and does not guarantee the privacy, security, authenticity and non-corruption of any information transmitted through, or stored in any system connected to, the Internet. eGain will use commercially reasonable efforts to adequately maintain, and upgrade as necessary, the eGain System to provide the Hosting Services to its customers. However, except as expressly set forth herein, eGain shall not be responsible for any delays, errors, failures to perform, or disruptions in the Hosting Services caused by or resulting from any act, omission or condition beyond eGain's reasonable control.\n\n7. Limitation of liability. EXCLUDING LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS DISCUSSED IN SECTION 9 OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL eGAIN BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS), OR BE LIABLE TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF eGAIN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. eGain's entire liability under this Agreement for any damages from any cause whatsoever, regardless of form or action, whether in contract, negligence or otherwise, shall in no event exceed an amount equal to the price paid for the Services out of which the claim arose.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Confidential Information. Each party agrees to keep confidential and to use only for purposes of performing (or as otherwise permitted under) this Agreement, any proprietary or confidential information of the other party disclosed pursuant to this Agreement which is marked as confidential or which would reasonably be considered of a confidential nature. The obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information which is publicly available through authorized disclosure, is known by the receiving party at the time of disclosure as evidenced in writing, is rightfully obtained from a third party who has the right to disclose it, or which is required by law, government order or request to be disclosed. Upon any termination of this Agreement, each party shall return to the other party all confidential information of the other party, and all copies thereof, in the possession, custody or control of the party unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.\n\n9. Indemnification. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9, eGain will defend any third-party suit or action against Customer to the extent such suit or action is based on a claim that the Software or the eGain System infringes any valid United States patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right, and eGain will pay those damages and costs finally awarded against Customer in any monetary settlement of such suit or action which are specifically attributable to such claim. These obligations do not include any claims to the extent they are based on use of the Software or eGain System in violation of this Agreement or in combination with any other software or hardware, or any modification to the Software or eGain System pursuant to Customer's specifications. If any portion of the Software or eGain System becomes, or in eGain's opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, then eGain may, at its option and expense, (a) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Software or the eGain System, or (b) replace or modify the Software or the eGain System so that it becomes non-infringing. The indemnity obligations set forth in this Section 9 are contingent upon: (i) Customer giving prompt written notice to the eGain of any such claim(s); (ii) eGain having sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim; and (iii) at eGain's request and expense, Customer cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s). THE FOREGOING STATES eGAIN'S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS.\n\n10. Term and Termination.\n\n10.1 Term and Termination. This Agreement shall continue in effect from the Effective Date for a one (1) year period, unless earlier terminated as set forth below, and thereafter shall renew automatically for successive one (1) year periods unless either party gives the other party at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of its intent not to renew the Agreement. In addition, either party may terminate this Agreement by giving to the other party written notice\n\neGAIN COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION\n\nHOSTING AGREEMENT\n\nof such termination upon the other party's material breach of any material term (subject to the other party's right to cure within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice), the other party's insolvency, or the institution of any bankruptcy or similar proceedings by or against the other party.\n\n10.2 Effect of Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, eGain shall immediately cease providing all Hosting Services, and Customer shall no longer have access to the Software or the eGain System. Except in the event of termination for Customer's breach, eGain shall provide Customer with an electronic copy of the final Reports (covering the month just prior to termination of this Agreement). eGain shall be entitled to retain a copy (whether electronic or otherwise) of the Online Messages and the Reports for its records and internal purposes and shall not disclose such Online Messages or Reports to any third party except as permitted under Section 4. Within fifteen (15) days of any termination of this Agreement, Customer shall pay to eGain all unpaid fees accrued prior to termination. Sections 4, 5 (as to amounts accrued but unpaid), 7, 8, 10.2 and 12 and Exhibit A (as to amounts accrued but unpaid) shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n11. Customer References. Customer agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, eGain may reference Customer in eGain's customer listings and may place Customer's name and logo on eGain's Web site and in collateral marketing materials relating to eGain's products and services. Customer hereby grants eGain a right to use Customer's trademarks (name and logo only) designated by Customer for such limited uses, subject to Customer's trademark/logo usage guidelines, if any, provided by Customer to eGain. With these limited exceptions, eGain agrees that it may not use Customer's name, logo or any other trademarks (including in any press releases, customer \"case studies,\" and the like) without Customer's prior consent.\n\n12. Miscellaneous. This Agreement, including Exhibit A and any other exhibits hereto, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements between the parties, with respect to the subject of this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement may be modified only by a writing signed by an authorized representative of each party. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California exclusive of its conflict of laws principles. Notices under this Agreement shall be in writing, addressed to the party at its last-provided address, and shall be deemed given when delivered personally, or by e-mail (with confirmation of receipt) or conventional mail (registered or certified, postage prepaid with return receipt requested). Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended or is to be construed to constitute eGain and Customer as partners or joint venturers or\n\n\n\n\n\neither party as an agent of the other. If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. All waivers of any rights or breach hereunder must be in writing to be effective, and no failure to enforce any right or provision shall be deemed to be a waiver of the same or other right or provision on that or any other occasion. Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent shall be required for an assignment of this Agreement made pursuant to a merger, consolidation, or the acquisition of all or substantially all of the business and assets of a party. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns.\n\nEach party agrees to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.\n\nCustomer: Eliance Corporation\n\nName:/s/                                 Title:                              ___________________________               _________\n\nSignature:______________________         Date:__________\n\neGain Communications Corporation:\n\nName:/s/                                 Title:                              ___________________________               _________\n\nSignature:______________________         Date:__________"

The omitted portions, marked by [****], have been separately filed with the Commission.\n\n                           SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT\n\nThis agreement (\"Agreement\") is entered into as of the 23rd day of September, 1997 (\"Effective Date\"), by and between Excite, Inc., a California corporation, located at 555 Broadway, Redwood City, California 94063 (\"Excite\"), and N2K Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, located at 55 Broad Street, 26th Floor, New York, New York, 10004 (\"Sponsor\").\n\n                                 RECITALS\n\nA.   Excite maintains a site on the Internet at http://www.excite.com (the      \"Excite Site\") and owns and/or manages related Web Sites worldwide      (collectively, the \"Excite Network\") which, among other things, allow users      to search for and access content and other sites on the Internet.\n\nB.   Excite also maintains and/or manages certain Web pages which may be      delivered to users via email, desktop \"channels\" or Internet \"push\"      technologies (collectively, \"Broadcast Pages\") which may incorporate      content supplied to Excite by third parties for the purpose of providing      value to Excite users and providing access to the content, products and/or      services of such third parties.\n\nC.   Sponsor is in the business of distributing certain online retail music      merchandise and related content and maintains a Web site at      http://www.musicblvd.com (the \"Sponsor Site\") and other Web sites through      which it makes this merchandise and this content available to its users.\n\nD.   Sponsor wishes to be the exclusive retail store music sponsor of the Excite      Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages, to distribute its music-related      content through the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages and to      promote its online retail music merchandise business to Excite.com users.\n\nTherefore, the parties agree as follows:\n\n1.       EXCLUSIVITY, TERM AND RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL\n\n      a)       Sponsor will be the exclusive retail music store sponsor of                   the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages. Excite will                   not permit the display of advertising banners, promotional                   buttons, promotional links or other promotional materials for                   any retail sale of Music Products on the Excite Site, except                   those Music Products offered by Sponsor, nor advertising by                   any other Retail Music Store. \"Retail Music Store\" shall mean                   any entity which is primarily engaged in the sale of Music                   Products at retail to consumers. \"Music Products\"     2                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n              shall mean pre-recorded music hard goods, digitally                  distributed music (except live and/or cybercast events), music                  books (to the extent this Agreement does not conflict with                  Excite's existing agreement with Amazon.com), music-related                  t-shirts and apparel, and music videos (except live and/or                  cybercast events).\n\n              Notwithstanding the foregoing, Excite may make available                  opportunities on the Excite Site to purchase Music Products                  from parties other than Sponsor if such Music Products are not                  available from Sponsor so long as, prior to entering into                  arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase Music                  Products from parties other than Sponsor, Excite notifies                  Sponsor of its interest in the Music Products and gives Sponsor                  thirty (30) days to make the desired Music Products available                  through the Sponsor Site. Excite and Sponsor acknowledge that                  certain market opportunities may arise in which the desired                  Music Products must be made available on less than thirty (30)                  days advance notice and will work together in good faith to                  maximize those opportunities. In no event will Excite enter                  into arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase                  Music Products from parties other than Sponsor that would                  prevent Sponsor from being the exclusive source of such Music                  Products on the Excite Site once the Music Products become                  available through Sponsor.\n\n      b)      The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and                  will end on the second (2nd) anniversary of the Commencement                  Date. The \"Commencement Date\" means the date on which Excite                  commences delivery of Impressions (defined below). The parties                  anticipate the Commencement Date will be on or about October                  15, 1997.\n\n      c)      The parties' existing agreements regarding sponsorship of the                  WebCrawler Web site (http://webcrawler.com) and all of the                  existing advertising buys on the Excite Network will be                  terminated as of the Commencement Date. Excite will credit                  Sponsor in an amount equal to [****]. This credit will be\n\n\n\n\n\n              applied to reduce the first year exclusivity fee described in                  Section 7(b) and will be reflected in a reduction of Sponsor's                  December 31, 1997 payment to Excite described in Section 7(e).\n\n      d)      Excite will offer Sponsor the right of first refusal to                  negotiate with Excite for renewal of this sponsorship.\n\n                                    2    3                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n               i) Excite will not propose, solicit or negotiate offers from                   entities other than Sponsor for any retail music store                   sponsorships of the Excite Site, if at all, until [****] prior                   to the expiration of the term of this Agreement.\n\n               ii) Commencing not later than [****] prior to the expiration                   of the term of the Agreement, Excite will negotiate with                   Sponsor in good faith with respect to the terms and conditions                   under which this Agreement would be renewed. Excite will                   negotiate exclusively with Sponsor for the next [****] in good                   faith effort to negotiate and execute a written sponsorship                   renewal agreement. If, [****] prior to the expiration of the                   term of the Agreement, the parties have not entered into a                   written sponsorship renewal agreement. Excite may enter into                   negotiations with any third party with respect to retail music                   store sponsorships of the Excite Site.\n\n               iii) In the event that Excite intends to enter into an                   agreement with a third party with respect to retail music                   store sponsorships of the Excite Site before the expiration of                   the term of the Agreement, Excite will deliver to Sponsor a                   written notice describing the relevant opportunity. Although                   Excite will not be required to disclose any information in                   violation of any nondisclosure agreement between Excite and                   any third party, the notice will include information                   sufficient to permit Sponsor to evaluate the requirements for                   meeting the competing offer for retail music store sponsorship                   of the Excite Site and to formulate a meaningful response.                   Sponsor will have [****] after receipt of such written notice                   to provide notice to Excite that it is prepared to enter into                   an agreement with Excite on the same terms and conditions as                   Excite proposes to accept from such third party. Excite and                   Sponsor will then promptly commence good faith negotiations to                   conclude the agreement.\n\n               iv) If Sponsor rejects said offer or fails to notify Excite of                   its acceptance within the [****] period, Excite shall have                   the right thereafter to enter into the agreement with such                   third party, provided the terms and conditions of the                   agreement (if entered into within the subsequent ninety (90)                   days) are not less favorable to Excite than previously offered                   by Sponsor.\n\n                                    3    4                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n2.       IMPRESSIONS\n\n      a)       \"Impression\" means any appearance of a link to the Sponsor                   Site whether graphic, text or any combination of graphic and                   text. More than one Impression may appear on a page, except,                   however, not more than three (3) Impressions per Channel page                   will count towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions and, of                   these 3 Impressions, at least two (2) will link to pages in                   the Sponsor Site offering Music Products; not more than two                   (2) Impressions per generic search results page will count                   towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions and, of these 2                   Impressions, at least one (1) will link to pages in the                   Sponsor Site offering Music Products; and no more than one (1)                   Impression per specific search results page will count towards                   delivery of guaranteed Impressions. In all events, Excite will                   make a good faith effort to avoid duplicate Impressions on a                   single page, but in no event will more than one (1)                   Impression for the same artist on a Music Product page count                   towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions. For the purposes                   of this Agreement, \"generic search results page\" is an Excite                   Search results page displayed in response to a query                   concerning generic music topics and a \"specific search results                   page\" is an Excite Search results page displayed in response                   to a query concerning a specific music artist or specific                   album title.\n\n      b)      Excite and Sponsor will work together in good faith to define                  mutually agreeable Impressions in the Excite Site designed to                  provide content of interest (defined below) to Excite users                  and/or promote the Sponsor Site, in numbers sufficient to meet                  the Impression guarantees stated in Section 3.\n\n      c)      Excite and Sponsor will collaborate on the design, appearance,                  and placement (the \"look and feel\") of all Impressions. Excite\n\n\n\n\n\n              will have final approval over the look and feel of the                  promotional Impressions, which approval will not be                  unreasonably withheld.\n\n3.       IMPRESSION GUARANTEES\n\n      a)       During the first year of the sponsorship following the                   Commencement Date, Excite will deliver not less than                   [****] Impressions on the Excite Site.\n\n      b)       During the second year of the sponsorship following the first                   anniversary of the Commencement Date, Excite will deliver not                   less than [****] Impressions on the Excite Site.\n\n                                    4    5                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n      c)       Excite will report traffic, Impressions and click-thrus to                   Sponsor on a monthly basis.\n\n4.

Each Co-Branded Page will display the name and/or brands of                   Sponsor and Excite.\n\n                                    5    6                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n               Sponsor and Excite will collaborate on the \"look and feel\" of                   the Co-Branded Pages including, but not limited to, the                   display, appearance and placement of the parties' respective                   names and/or brands and of advertising displayed on the                   Co-Branded Pages. Excite will have final approval over the                   \"look and feel\" of the Co-Branded Pages, which approval will                   not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n      b)       The Co-Branded Area will reside completely on the Sponsor                   Site.

Excite will supply Sponsor with the URLs for                   these links.\n\n      d)       Excite may, upon fifteen (15) days prior notice to Sponsor,                   request reasonable revisions to the Co-Branded Area as needed                   to reflect changes that will not adversely affect Sponsor,                   such as changes to Excite's name and/or brand or changes to                   the URLs for the links to the Excite Site.

This                            three-month Total Revenue amount will be compared to                            an amount equal to two (2) times the corresponding                            three-month share of the applicable sponsorship fee                            described in Sections 6(c) and 6(d) (each pro rata                            share a \"Revenue Floor\").\n\n                                    8    9                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n               iii)     If the Total Revenue earned by Sponsor during the                            three-month period exceeds the total of the Revenue                            Floor applicable to the same three-month period,                            Sponsor will pay Excite [****] of the gross margin                            Sponsor realizes on the gross revenue amount equal to                            the excess of the Total Revenue over the Revenue                             Floor during the three-month period.                   iv)      If the Total Revenue earned by Sponsor during the                            three-month period does not exceed the Revenue Floor                            applicable to the same three-month period, Sponsor                            will not be obligated to pay Excite any share of the                            gross revenue realized during the three-month period.\n\n      g)       Payments of shared gross margin will be due to Excite within                   thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter in which                   the revenue is recognized by Sponsor.\n\n      h)       With each payment, Sponsor will provide to Excite                   documentation reasonably detailing the calculation of the                   payment.\n\n      i)       Sponsor will maintain accurate records with respect to the                   calculation of all payments due under this Agreement. Excite                   may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice                   to Sponsor, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant                   to inspect the records of Sponsor reasonably related to the                   calculation of such payments during Sponsor's normal business                   hours. The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant in                   connection with the inspection will be paid by Excite unless                   the payments made to Excite are determined to have been less                   than ninety percent (90%) of the payment owed to Excite, in                   which case Sponsor will be responsible for the payment of the                   reasonable fees for such inspection.\n\n8.

TERMINATION             a)       If Excite fails to deliver the guaranteed number of                   Impressions on the Excite Site during the first year, Excite                   will use commercially reasonable efforts to \"make good\" the                   shortfall. If Excite fails to \"make good\" the shortfall within                   [****] following the first year end, Sponsor may terminate the                   Agreement in accordance with Section 11 (b).\n\n      b)       If Excite fails to deliver the guaranteed number of                   Impressions on the Excite Site during the second year, Excite                   will use commercially reasonable efforts to \"make good\" the                   shortfall within [****] following the second year end.                   However, the term of this Agreement will continue until Excite                   has made good the guaranteed number of Impressions on the                   Excite Site. Sponsor will not be obligated to make                   sponsorship, advertising or exclusivity payments to Excite                   during the \"make good\" period after the second year of the                   Agreement, but Sponsor will continue to make revenue sharing                   payments as described in Section 7(e). For the purposes of the                   calculation of revenue sharing during this \"make good\" period                   only, the \"Revenue Floor\" from the last quarter of the second                   year of the term of the Agreement will apply.          c)       Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party                   materially breaches its obligations hereunder and such breach                   remains uncured for thirty (30) days following the notice to                   the breaching party of the breach, with the following                   exceptions:\n\n               i)       Excite will promptly notify Sponsor of any errors,                            failures or outages of the Content. Sponsor will                            promptly notify Excite of any errors, failures or                            outages of the Co-Branded Area.\n\n                                    11    12                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n                        Sponsor will take all reasonable measures to correct                            any such errors or outages as soon as reasonably                            possible.

The parties are independent contractors and will                   have no power or authority to assume or create any obligation                   or responsibility on behalf of each other. This Agreement will                   not be construed to create or imply any partnership, agency or                   joint venture.\n\n      e)       Force Majeure. Any delay in or failure of performance by                   either party under this Agreement will not be considered a                   breach of this Agreement and will be excused to the extent                   caused by any occurrence beyond the reasonable control of such                   party including,\n\n                                    16    17                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n               but not limited to, acts of God, power outages and                   governmental restrictions.\n\n      f)       Severability. In the event that any of the provisions of this                   Agreement are held by to be unenforceable by a court or                   arbitrator, the remaining portions of the Agreement will                   remain in full force and effect.\n\n      g)       Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive                   agreement between the parties with respect to the subject                   matter hereof, superseding any prior agreements and                   communications (both written and oral) regarding such subject                   matter.

REGARDING DEVELOPMENT OF WATER WELL(S) IN THE CAPITAN REEF AQUIFER FORMATION\n\nThis AGREEMENT regarding development of water well(s) in the Capitan Reef Aquifer Formation (the \"AGREEMENT\") is entered into by the City of Fort Stockton, Texas, a Texas Type A-General Law city (\"COFS\") and STW Resources Holding Corp., a Nevada corporation (\"STW\"), effective as of the last date of signature on the signature pages below. STW and COFS are sometimes individually referred to as a \"Party\" and collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\"\n\nWHEREAS, the City of Fort Stockton, Texas (\"COFS\") owns the surface and groundwater rights to several areas of the Capitan Reef Aquifer Formation; and\n\nWHEREAS, COFS has an existing Capitan Reef Aquifer (\"CRA\") water well located at Section 112 on COFS property, which is currently drilled to an approximate depth of 3,500 feet (the \"Existing CRA Well\"), and also owns property at Section 71; and\n\nWHEREAS, STW desires to attempt to deepen the Existing CRA Well in order to make it a producing water well and/or drill an alternate well(s) at its own expense, and to lease CRA groundwater rights from Sections 112 and 71 of COFS property; and   WHEREAS, STW and COFS desire to work together for the development of a CRA water supply project within the area that will serve to meet the future needs of COFS and the municipal and industrial needs within the region.\n\nTHE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE AS FOLLOWS:\n\n1.  Leasing of Property  and Drilling  of Water Well(s). COFS hereby grants, leases and lets unto STW the right to explore for, drill for, produce, utilize, transport, and treat groundwater from the CRA only from beneath the surface of the property more specifically described in Exhibit \"A,\" which is attached hereto and fully incorporated into this AGREEMENT (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Property\"). STW is further authorized to drill, deepen, and/or rework at its expense the Existing CRA Well on Section 112 of the Property from its current depth of approximately 3,500 feet to approximately 4,000 feet, so as to determine the following to be verified by a study to be performed by a hydrogeologist mutually agreed upon by both Parties (\"Post-Well Study\"): (a) the gallons per day (\"GPD\") of maximum water capacity of the Existing CRA Well or alternate well, as may be required under Section 5 of the AGREEMENT; and (b) the quality of the water to be obtained from the Existing CRA Well or alternate well. The rights granted to STW under this AGREEMENT also include the right of access to the Property to perform the activities authorized herein.   2.  Acces s and Surface Use. STW agrees to coordinate reasonably with COFS with respect to location of any new wells, roadways, power infrastructure, and other improvements that are to be constructed or used on the Property. COFS shall provide STW rent free site leases for the commercially reasonable amounts of surface area required for CRA pumping and filling stations located on the Property. STW shall pay for or repair all actual damages to roads, fences, or improvements caused by its activities on the Property within sixty (60) days of the occurrence, and will fill and level all pits, mounds, ruts, and shall restore the surface to as near its original condition as is reasonably practicable within ninety (90) days after termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT related only to the Property. Upon termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT related to the Property only, STW, or its successors or assigns, shall transfer title of all water conveyance pipelines from the Property to COFS. STW shall administer and provide all necessary and reasonable insurance to insure its activities on the Property in relation to the AGREEMENT and shall list COFS as additional insured.\n\n  -1-\n\n\n\n\n\n    3.  Term.  Subject to the other provisions contained herein, this AGREEMENT shall be for a term of thirty (30) years from the Effective Date, which shall automatically renew from year-to-year thereafter unless terminated by a Party upon sixty (60) days' written notice after the end of the term. Notwithstanding the 30-year term of this agreement, should STW procure sales agreements with customers for a duration of longer than 30 years, STW shall be authorized to maintain and service such contract(s) to the extent of the water volume(s) purchased, and this AGREEMENT shall not terminate during the initial term of any such water supply agreement with a term extending beyond this AGREEMENT.   4.  Post-Well  Study Generally. The Post-Well Study shall provide information on the feasibility of developing a water well field in that location that would produce water from the CRA for: (a) the availability of a minimum 1,200 gallons per minute (\"GPM\") per day CRA water production for STW, its successors or assignees, to sell to communities and users within a 500-mile radius outside of COFS (the \"Permitted Sale Water\") during the Term, with the further requirement that STW would be responsible for the pipelines and pumping facilities required to transport the Permitted Sale Water to the intended end-users; and that all such water obtained from the Existing CRA Well contains acceptable levels of Total Dissolved Solids (\"TDS\") to meet municipal use standards. If such water does not meet municipal use standards according to the Post-Well Study, STW may either treat the water to municipal use standards or to sell it as-is to industrial end-users.   5.  Replacement CRA Well. If, based on the Post-Well Study of the Existing CRA Well, it is determined that the Existing CRA Well is not suitable for the purposes of this AGREEMENT, then STW may elect to drill at its expense a second water well (the \"Replacement CRA Well\") at a place to be mutually agreed on the Property, with the Existing CRA Well to remain as a monitoring well. After completion of the Replacement CRA Well, a second Post-Well Study will be conducted for the same purposes as that for the Existing CRA Well.   6.  Construction Requirements. STW's construction of the improvements to the Existing CRA Well, any Replacement CRA Well, and any additional production wells shall be pursuant to any recommendation and requirements as may be specified by and agreed upon with COFS, and the construction shall also be conducted in a manner meeting prevailing industry standards, the Middle Pecos Groundwater Conservation District regulations, Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulations, and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) regulations.   7.  Cooperation  Regarding  Studies. COFS shall provide to STW any and all documents pertaining to this project, including all hydrogeological studies and any existing Pre-Well Studies for the Existing CRA Well, as well as any similar documents for the Replacement CRA Well to include:   a.  the best location for the Replacement CRA Well on the Property, considering the spacing with any other wells that might now or in the future be located on the Property;   b.  the location on the Property that will best provide data for determining the feasibility of pumping water from the CRA on the Property and be the most productive;   c.  documents showing current ownership of the Property including both CRA and surface ownership rights, to demonstrate COFS' ability to lease the land for the Sale of CRA Water Rights to STW, including any documents showing the prior sale or conveyance of any CRA or water rights from the Property; and   d.  names and addresses of engineers and/or hydrogeologists recommended to perform the Post-Well Study (ies). The Post-Well Study (ies) shall be performed by a hydrogeologist(s) mutually agreed to by both Parties.\n\n  -2-\n\n\n\n\n\n    8.  Post-Well Study Requirements. Any Post-Well Studies shall be paid for by STW and shall include:   a.  a chemical analysis and performance by a qualified certified laboratory mutually approved by the Parties to determine the quality of the water and its characteristics at that location;   b.  any documents related to the drawdown or recharge rate affecting the producing capacity; and   c.  TDS measurements of CRA water produced by STW.   9.  COFS Responsibilities.   COFS shall perform the following services:   a.  administer and provide all necessary insurance to insure its activities in relation to the AGREEMENT; and   b.  possess or obtain any and all necessary property rights for the activities covered in this AGREEMENT, including both CRA and surface rights to the Property.   10.  Construction and Post-Well Study Costs.  STW will pay all reasonable and necessary costs to: (a) construct the improvements to the Existing CRA Well or the Replacement CRA Well (including the cost of securing any necessary regulatory approval for the improvements to the Existing CRA Well and the Replacement CRA Well); (b) obtain the Post-Well Study (ies); and (c) reasonable consulting costs related to the negotiation and execution of the AGREEMENT.   11.  STW Termination Rights. STW shall have the right to unilaterally terminate the provisions of this AGREEMENT related only to the Property, and not proceed further after the completion of any phase of the project and not incur any additional costs. So long as STW is progressing through the following phases, and subject to the other terms of this AGREEMENT, COFS may not terminate the AGREEMENT during the:   a.  Pre-well study (ies),   b.  completion of improvements to the Existing CRA Well,   c.  completion of the Replacement CRA Well, if necessary, and   d.  Post-Well Study (ies).   Should COFS unilaterally terminate the provisions of this AGREEMENT related to COFS Property only, with the right to do so beginning on a period beginning no sooner than ninety (90) days following the Post-Well Study (ies), and ending at the one year period following the Post-Well Study (ies), during which STW may exercise its Option to Produce Water, in accordance with Section 15 of this AGREEMENT, COFS shall reimburse STW for 100% of the costs paid by STW up to the point of such termination, pursuant to the AGREEMENT, according to a reasonable accounting schedule of costs prepared by STW and submitted to COFS. Once STW exercises its Option to Produce Water pursuant to Section 15 of this AGREEMENT, and pays COFS its Bonus Payment, in accordance with Section 14(b) of this AGREEMENT, COFS may no longer unilaterally terminate this AGREEMENT during the Term. If STW terminates the AGREEMENT and COFS sells water within twenty (20) years from the Effective Date of this AGREEMENT from one or more producing water well(s) developed by STW, STW shall be reimbursed the amount expended for drilling the producing well(s), to be paid from the sale of water produced by COFS from the producing well(s). Such reimbursement shall occur based on COFS' net revenues received from CRA water sales from the producing well(s) in six (6) month increments, which shall begin on the date COFS begins selling CRA water from producing water well(s), and shall end upon reimbursement in full of the amount STW is owed for drilling any producing well(s).\n\n  -3-\n\n\n\n\n\n    12.  Title of Producing Wells. Title and ownership of the Existing CRA Well, the Replacement CRA Well and any additional wells drilled on the Property by STW (the \"Additional Wells\") shall be transferred to STW by COFS and shall be held by STW; however, upon termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT that relate to COFS Property, STW shall transfer the title(s) back to COFS upon COFS' reimbursement of STW as necessary under this AGREEMENT.   13.  Uses, Maintenance, Construction and Operation of Wells. STW will construct, maintain, operate, own, and repair (as needed) the Existing CRA Well, the Replacement CRA Well and any Additional Wells, and in doing so, and in the wells' operation and repair, STW shall:   a.  conduct all work and operations in a businesslike manner consistent with good and economical practices and with due regard for good land management, damage prevention and environmental protection;   b.  comply with all federal, state, and local laws, regulations and requirements governing the development, production, collection, transportation, and disposal of the water (and any waste or reject water);   c.  allow COFS or its authorized representatives to enter upon the premises at reasonable times to be arranged in advance of entry; and   d.  plug all wells, when abandoned, in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements of the Middle Pecos Groundwater Conservation District, TDLR, and/or TCEQ.   14.  Obligations Following the Post-Well Study.   a.  For purposes of this section, the Post-Well Study must show that the Existing CRA Well or Replacement CRA Well can produce CRA water at a minimum of 1,200 GPM or more or a combination of 1,200 GPM from one or more wells on the Property in order for STW to proceed with the obligations set forth in this section (\"Critical Criterion\").   b.  Obligations if Post-Well Study shows that the Critical Criterion has been met:   If all necessary regulatory approvals are obtained that allow the production and transport of up to 10 million GPD or the maximum capacity of the well, for STW's use or resale, in conjunction with STW exercising its Option to Produce Water under Section 15 of this AGREEMENT, STW will pay COFS an upfront Bonus Payment of Five Million and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00), and STW shall have the immediate right to develop Additional Wells on the Property, subject to all necessary regulatory approvals, in the event STW procures additional water supply contracts that require additional volume of production, the feasibility of which shall be by a Post Well hydrogeological study and report that shows the ability of STW to produce the additional amounts of CRA water. STW shall have the right to the sale of and transport of such additional water produced from Additional Wells. STW shall pay COFS a seventeen percent (17%) royalty of the price STW receives per 1,000 gallons of CRA water produced from the Property and sold.   STW shall also provide to COFS three (3) million GPD of CRA water at no cost to COFS at such time that COFS requests delivery of the water for COFS use. Each payment made by STW to COFS will include an accounting statement providing the number of gallons sold, the price paid by any customer(s), the gross revenues received by STW, and the expenses paid by STW for the sale, treatment, use, and/or delivery of the CRA water. STW shall calculate the amount owed to COFS every one hundred-eighty (180) days (\"Accrual Period\"), and shall provide required payments to COFS within thirty (30) days after the end of the previous Accrual Period.\n\n  -4-\n\n\n\n\n\n    c.  Options if Post-Well Study shows that the Critical Criterion has not been met:   (1)  STW may choose to not pursue the production and transport of the water from the Property. If one or more producing wells are developed by STW and COFS sells the CRA water produced from the well(s), COFS will reimburse STW from the net revenues COFS receives up to the point STW has been fully reimbursed for drilling any producing well(s) if such sale occurs within twenty (20) years from the date of this AGREEMENT.   (2)  STW may choose to pursue the production and transport of the water. STW shall have the right to produce and transport the water upon obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals, and will not seek reimbursement of any of its costs incurred pursuant to the AGREEMENT.   (3)  If regulatory approvals have been granted, but the permit obtained from the Middle Pecos Groundwater Conservation District allows the transport of less than the full amount requested for STW's use or sale, then STW may:   i.  elect to produce and transport the water; or   ii.  elect to not produce and transport the water, in which case the conditions of Subsection (c)(1) of this section shall apply.   15.  Option to Produce Water.   a.  STW will have one year from completion of the last of the Post-Well Study (ies) completed on the Existing CRA Well or Replacement CRA Well to exercise its option to produce and transport the water produced from the CRA on the Property (\"Option to Produce\"). The AGREEMENT shall thereafter terminate as to both Parties if STW has not exercised its Option to Produce at the expiration of the one-year period unless STW pays as royalty on the first day of each month the sum of Five Hundred and 00/100 Dollars ($500.00) per month. STW shall have no right to maintain this AGREEMENT through payment of such a royalty for any one period greater than three consecutive years.   b.  If, after STW has exercised its option to produce CRA water from the Property, one or more producing wells on the Property are capable of producing CRA water for sale, but CRA water is not being sold for a consecutive period of 180 days or more, then the lease shall terminate as to both parties unless STW pays as royalty on the first day of each month after such period of 180 days, the sum of Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000) per month. STW shall have no right to maintain this AGREEMENT through payment of such a royalty for any one period greater than three (3) consecutive years.   c.  If STW exercises its option to produce and transport the CRA water, STW will construct additional facilities or expand existing facilities, as necessary, to be able to produce and transport the CRA water for sale.     -5-\n\n\n\n\n\n    16.  Payment for Use of COFS Pipeline Easements and COFS Assistance with Project.   a.  STW shall be entitled to use existing COFS easements and right of ways within Pecos County for laying of pipelines necessary for the delivery of CRA water produced within Pecos County. COFS will assist STW with any negotiations required to procure any additional easements and groundwater rights in Pecos County that are necessary for the production and delivery of CRA water. STW shall also be entitled to use and upgrade existing COFS water treatment infrastructure as necessary for the treatment of raw CRA water. STW shall pay COFS a seven percent (7%) royalty of the price STW receives per 1,000 gallons of CRA water produced from other properties within Pecos County and sold as consideration for the rights provided by COFS to STW under this subsection. Such payment shall be made according to the schedule and terms set forth in Section 14(b) of this AGREEMENT. The requirements under this Section 16 shall remain in force and effect despite any termination of those provisions of this AGREEMENT that apply only to COFS Property. The provisions of this section shall terminate in the event STW is not producing CRA water from other properties in Pecos County for sale due to termination of all such agreements or failure of STW to enter into such agreements regarding other properties in Pecos County within ten (10) years from the Effective Date of this AGREEMENT.   b.  COFS shall manage well maintenance and production operations for all CRA water produced within Pecos County under the direction of STW. STW shall pay COFS for its reasonable costs incurred to manage such well maintenance and production operations.   c.  STW shall conduct all necessary storage, holding, and treatment of CRA water produced from the Property and from other properties within Pecos County, as set forth in Subsection (a) of this section, within the boundaries of Pecos County.   17.  Authorized Third Party Beneficiary.   STW shall be listed as a third party beneficiary to any contracts to guarantee payment of any of the obligations of this contract between COFS and Pecos County or any other entity or individual.   18.

COFS shall bear and pay any ad valorem taxes assessed directly against COFS' royalty, any federal or state income taxes payable on the royalty and on the other compensation payable to COFS under this AGREEMENT, and taxes assessed on COFS' ownership of the surface of the Property and other minerals not conveyed under this AGREEMENT.   21.  Governmental Authority. STW shall be responsible for obtaining any approval required from any applicable governmental authority with jurisdiction over the activities under this AGREEMENT. COFS shall assist STW with any documentation needed to obtain the necessary approvals required.\n\n  -6-\n\n\n\n\n\n    22.  Force Majeure. If a Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, to carry out any of its obligations under the Agreement, other than an obligation to pay money, as a result of Force Majeure, then its obligations shall be suspended, to the extent affected by such Force Majeure, during the continuance of any inability so caused, provided that notice of the Force Majeure is provided to the other Party as soon as reasonably practicable. The Party claiming the Force Majeure shall use due diligence to resume performance at the earliest practicable time, and such suspension shall not extend for a period longer than twenty-four (24) months from the date notice of the Force Majeure is provided without payment as set forth under Section 15(a) of this AGREEMENT by STW, or the option to terminate this AGREEMENT by STW if COFS is the party asserting the Force Majeure.   23.

[***].\n\n6.8 Withholding Taxes.\n\n6.8.1 Withholding Amounts. Where any sum due to be paid to either Party hereunder is subject to any withholding or similar tax, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to do all such acts and things and to sign all such documents as will enable them to take advantage of any applicable double taxation agreement or treaty. In the event there is no applicable double taxation agreement or treaty, or if an applicable double taxation agreement or treaty reduces but does not eliminate such withholding or similar tax, the payor shall remit such withholding or similar tax to the appropriate government authority, deduct the amount paid from the amount due to payee and secure and send to payee the best available evidence of the payment of such withholding or similar tax. Any such amounts deducted by the payor in respect of such withholding or similar tax shall be treated as having been paid by the payor for purposes of this Agreement. If withholding or similar taxes are paid to a government authority, each Party will provide the other such assistance as is reasonably required to obtain a refund of the withheld or similar taxes, or to obtain a credit with respect to such taxes paid. In the event that a government authority retroactively determines that a payment made by the paying Party to the receiving Party pursuant to this Agreement should have been subject to withholding or similar (or to additional withholding or similar) taxes, and such paying Party (the \"Withholding Party\") remits such withholding or similar taxes to the government authority, including any interest and penalties that may be imposed thereon (together with the tax paid, the \"Withholding Amount\"), the Withholding Party will have the right (a) to offset the Withholding Amount against future payment obligations of the Withholding Party under this Agreement or (b) to invoice the receiving Party for the Withholding Amount (which shall be payable by the receiving Party within [***] of its receipt of such invoice), or to pursue reimbursement of the Withholding Amount by any other available remedy.\n\n6.8.2 Withholding Actions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that if AbbVie (or its assignee pursuant to Section 13.4) is required by Applicable Law to withhold taxes in respect of any amount payable under this Agreement, and if such withholding obligation arises as a result of any action taken by AbbVie or its Affiliate or successor or assignee, including without limitation an assignment of this Agreement as permitted under Section 13.4 of this Agreement, a change in tax residency of AbbVie, or payments arise or are deemed to arise through a branch of AbbVie and such withholding taxes exceed the amount of withholding taxes that would have been applicable if such action had not occurred (each an \"AbbVie Withholding Tax Action\"), then, any such amount payable shall be increased to take into account such increased withholding taxes as may be necessary so that, after making all required withholdings Harpoon (or its assignee pursuant to Section 13.4) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such AbbVie Withholding Tax Action occurred. Harpoon shall (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an exemption of such withheld amounts to the extent practicable under Applicable Law and (b) cooperate with AbbVie to obtain a reduction or refund of such withheld amounts.\n\n6.9 Indirect Taxes. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all payments due under this Agreement are exclusive of value added taxes, sales taxes, consumption taxes and other similar taxes (the \"Indirect Taxes\"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, AbbVie shall be responsible for any Indirect Taxes as well as any transfer, documentary, sales use, stamp, registration, value added or other similar tax that is imposed with respect to the payments or the related transfer of rights or other property pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. If the Indirect Taxes originally paid or otherwise borne by the paying Party are in whole or in part subsequently determined not to have been chargeable, all reasonably necessary steps will be taken by the receiving Party to receive a refund of these undue Indirect Taxes from the\n\n- 40 -\n\nSource: HARPOON THERAPEUTICS, INC., 10-K, 3/12/2020\n\n\n\n\n\napplicable governmental authority or other fiscal authority and any amount of undue Indirect Taxes repaid by such authority to the receiving Party will be transferred to the paying Party within [***] of receipt.\n\n6.10 Interest on Late Payments. If any payment due to either Party under this Agreement is not paid when due, then such paying Party shall pay interest thereon (before and after any judgment) at [***] such interest to run from the date on which payment of such sum became due until payment thereof in full together with such interest; provided however that [***], then such interest [***], as adjusted from time to time on the [***].\n\n6.11 Audit. AbbVie shall, shall cause its Affiliates to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Sublicensees to, keep complete and accurate books and records pertaining to Net Sales of Licensed Products, in sufficient detail to calculate all amounts payable hereunder. At the request of Harpoon, AbbVie shall permit an independent public accounting firm of nationally recognized standing designated by Harpoon and reasonably acceptable to AbbVie, [***], to audit the books and records maintained pursuant to this Section 6.11 to ensure the accuracy of all reports and payments made hereunder, including any permitted deductions from Net Sales pursuant to Section 1.108. Such examinations may not (a) be conducted for any [***] [***] (b) be conducted more than once in any [***] period or (c) be [***] (unless a previous audit revealed an underpayment with respect to such [***]). The accounting firm shall disclose to Harpoon only whether the reports are correct or not, and the specific details concerning any discrepancies. No other information shall be shared. Except as provided below, the cost of this audit shall be borne by Harpoon, unless the audit reveals a variance [***] from the reported amounts or [***], in which case AbbVie shall bear the cost of the audit.\n\n6.12 Audit Dispute. In the event of a dispute with respect to any audit under Section 6.11, Harpoon and AbbVie shall work in good faith to resolve the disagreement. If the Parties are unable to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of any such dispute within [***], the dispute shall be submitted for resolution to a certified public accounting firm jointly selected by each Party's certified public accountants or to such other Person as the Parties shall mutually agree (the \"Audit Expert\"). The decision of the Audit Expert shall be final and the costs of such determination as well as the initial audit shall be borne between the Parties in such manner as the Audit Expert shall determine. Not later than [***] after such decision and in accordance with such decision, AbbVie shall pay the additional amounts or Harpoon shall reimburse the excess payments, as applicable.\n\n6.13 Confidentiality. The receiving Party shall treat all information subject to review under this Article 6 in accordance with the confidentiality provisions of Article 9 and the Parties shall cause the Audit Expert to enter into a reasonably acceptable confidentiality agreement with AbbVie obligating such firm to retain all such financial information in confidence pursuant to such confidentiality agreement.\n\n6.14 [***] The development and regulatory milestone payments, first commercial sales milestone payments, sales-based milestone payments and royalties in Sections 6.2, 6.3 6.4, and 6.5 shall not apply at the same rates to Development and Commercialization of Licensed Compounds or Licensed Products [***] for eligibility to be treated for such disease, state, or condition with a Licensed Compound or Licensed Product or for monitoring patients who are or have been treated with a Licensed Compound or Licensed Product.

All indemnification claims in respect of a Party, its Affiliates, or their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be made solely by such Party to this Agreement (the \"Indemnified Party\"). The Indemnified Party shall give the indemnifying Party prompt written notice (an \"Indemnification Claim Notice\") of any Losses or discovery of fact upon which such Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification under this Article 11, but in no event shall the indemnifying Party be liable for any Losses to the extent resulting from any delay in providing such notice.

The Indemnified Party shall furnish promptly to the indemnifying Party copies of all papers and official documents received in respect of any Losses and Third Party Claims.\n\n11.4 Control of Defense.\n\n11.4.1 In General. Subject to the provisions of Sections 7.4 (if applicable), 7.5 and 7.6, at its option, the indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Third Party Claim by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after the indemnifying Party's receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice. The assumption of the defense of a Third Party Claim by the indemnifying Party shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that the indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of the Third Party Claim, nor shall it constitute a waiver by the indemnifying Party of any defenses it may assert against the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of the Third Party Claim any legal counsel selected by the indemnifying Party which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. In the event the indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the indemnifying Party all original notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party in connection with the Third Party Claim. Should the indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, except as provided in Section 11.4.2, the indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim unless specifically requested in writing by the indemnifying Party. In the event that it is ultimately determined that the indemnifying Party is not obligated to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Indemnified Party from and against the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the indemnifying Party for any Losses incurred by the indemnifying Party in its defense of the Third Party Claim.\n\n11.4.2 Right to Participate in Defense.

Complete, unredacted copies of this exhibit have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of this Company's confidential treatment request.\n\nDistributor Agreement                              ---------------------\n\nThis Distributor Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is made effective as of the 31st day of March, 2000 (the \"Effective Date\"), by and between Airspan Networks Incorporated, a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington having its principal office at 777 108th Avenue NE, Suite 1895, Bellevue, Washington 98004 (\"Airspan\") and GLS LLC, (\"Distributor\") a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the State of South Dakota having its principal office at 501 Fourth Street, Sergeant Bluff, IA 51054.\n\nWITNESSETH:\n\nWHEREAS, Airspan is engaged in the design and manufacture of various telecommunications product lines, including, among others, those product lines more completely described in Schedule I hereto (the product lines described in Schedule I, as from time to time amended in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, are hereinafter called the \"Airspan Products\") the hardware components thereof are sometimes referred to separately as \"Equipment,\" the software components thereof are sometimes referred to separately as \"Software\" as defined in Section 11.1, and an arrangement of Equipment which, when interfaced with Software, is operable to perform predetermined functions, is referred to as a \"System\");\n\nWHEREAS, Distributor is engaged in the promotion of sales of telecommunications products; and\n\nWHEREAS, Airspan desires to appoint Distributor as a Distributor for the Airspan Products for the territory described in Schedule II hereto (the \"Territory\").\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, it is hereby agreed as follows:\n\n1.   APPOINTMENT.      -----------\n\n1.1  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Airspan hereby appoints Distributor as an independent, exclusive distributor to assist Airspan in marketing the Airspan Products to customers in the Territory, and Distributor hereby accepts such appointment as of the Effective Date of this Agreement. Distributor's appointment as a distributor of the Airspan Products grants to Distributor only a license to resell the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 1\n\nAirspan Products to Distributor's customers in the Territory, and does not transfer any right, title, or interest in any of the Airspan Software to Distributor.\n\n1.2  Distributor's relationship to Airspan is that of an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall constitute Distributor as the agent or employee of Airspan.  Distributor shall have no authority to accept any order or make any offer (except as herein stated), or execute any instrument or make any commitment on behalf of Airspan.  Specifically, without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, Distributor agrees not to make any representation, guarantee, or warranty on Airspan's behalf concerning the Airspan Products, but will refer customers to Airspan's printed literature. Nothing contained in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation or restriction upon Airspan in the sale or other disposition of any of its products to any person, firm, or corporation inside or outside of the Territory. Airspan will pay no commissions under this Agreement.  Distributor's compensation is to be obtained solely by the difference between the price Distributor pays to Airspan and the price Distributor charges its customers. The parties also acknowledge that this Agreement is not intended to create a joint venture or partnership between Airspan and Distributor.\n\n1.3  Distributor will use its best efforts to maintain and support the Airspan Products within the Territory by devoting such attention, time, and effort as may be reasonably necessary to fully develop the available market potential.  During the term of this Agreement, and for a period of three (3) months following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Distributor agrees that neither it nor any organization or entity controlled or directed by it will, without Airspan's prior, written consent, represent a manufacturer or supplier of products similar in design or performance to or which are of such a nature as to be competitive with any products contained in the Airspan Products, nor will Distributor market or otherwise promote the sale of such products. Distributor will give Airspan thirty (30) days' prior, written notice of each new potential representation role being considered by Distributor, and Distributor will not undertake such representation without Airspan's prior, written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Except as\n\n\n\n\n\nprovided above, in no event will Airspan consent to Distributor's consultation for or representation of a manufacturer or supplier, which is directly or indirectly, a competitor of Airspan.\n\n1.4  Distributor shall maintain a place of business at the location specified in Section 21.10 where Distributor can be contacted by Airspan, customers, and prospective customers during regular business hours with a permanent mailing address and an accessible cellular telephone, and will provide Airspan with written notice promptly upon any change in address.  Distributor agrees to assume all of the expenses of this place of business, including rent, stenographic services, and all other expenses except as specifically assumed in writing by Airspan.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 2\n\n1.5  Airspan will provide Distributor with such commercial and technical assistance and training as may reasonably be necessary, in Airspan's sole judgment, to enable Distributor to effectively carry out its activities under this Agreement and, in connection therewith, to provide such sales promotional materials, as Airspan may deem appropriate.  Airspan will provide such technical support as is reasonable and necessary to maintain the product line as a viable competitor in the market.\n\n2.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.\n\nDistributor hereby represents and warrants as follows:\n\na.   Distributor has been duly registered in accordance with any and all relevant legislation, has received any and all necessary governmental authorizations to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement, and that its entry into and performance under this Agreement will not violate applicable legislation;\n\nb.

Distributor's bank accounts have been established and operated in accordance with applicable legislation.  All transactions of Distributor required to be carried out through authorized banks have been so carried out.

Distributor will conduct or provide for      any training of its personnel which may be necessary to impart such      knowledge.\n\n3.5  Distributor and its staff will research the technical requirements and      specifications of the market for Airspan Products in the Territory and make      information known to Airspan such that Airspan may, at its discretion,      implement appropriate technical changes to the Products to enable them to      be sold in the Territory. Airspan acknowledges that, subject to a further      and separate Agreement, such changes may be implemented in the future by      Distributor, with the assistance of Airspan.\n\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 4\n\n3.6  Distributor agrees to purchase and stock a comprehensive inventory of      spare parts based upon the recommended list set forth in Schedule III to      this Agreement.\n\n3.7  Distributor agrees to provide to its customers' installation services      for all Airspan Products.

Distributor further agrees to provide all of the sales and support      functions set forth in this section at no charge to Airspan.\n\n3.10 Distributor agrees not to actively seek to promote, rent, lease, sell,      sublicense or authorize the rental, sale or sublicense of Airspan Products      outside of the Territory [without the prior written approval of Airspan],      but nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Distributor from renting,      selling or sublicensing the Airspan Products to customers outside of the      Territory in response to an unsolicited request from such customer.\n\n3.11 During the term of this Agreement Distributor agrees that neither it      nor any organization or entity controlled or directed by it will, without      Airspan's prior, written consent, represent a manufacturer or supplier of      products similar in design or performance to or which are of such a nature      as to be competitive with any products contained in the Airspan Products.\n\n3.12 The parties mutually agree that by April 30, 2000, the parties will      negotiate and execute a National Accounts Consulting Agreement whereby the      Distributor will receive consulting fees and commissions for the sale and      deployment of Airspan's products on a national basis.

Products      shall only be deemed similar if they provide like functionality.

Any Installation Services or other services provided      by Airspan will be invoiced separately following completion of such      services.  The Invoice also shall state the total due to Airspan from      Distributor (the \"Invoice Total\"), which shall include the Contract Price,      and any applicable taxes, duties, and other fees due pursuant to Section 6      of this Agreement. Payment of the Invoice Total is due (without any right      of set-off) Net forty-five (45) days after the date of invoice.\n\n7.2  If Distributor disputes any invoice or part thereof, Distributor      must notify Airspan in writing within twenty-five (25) days of the invoice      date giving details of the reason for such dispute.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 8\n\nDistributor and Airspan agree to work together in good faith to resolve the      dispute as quickly as possible.

Unless specified in the      Purchase Order, Airspan will select the mode of shipment and the carrier.\n\nIn this Agreement, \"Incoterms\" means the most recent international rules      for the interpretation of trade terms published by the International      Chamber of Commerce as in force on the Effective Date.  Unless the context      otherwise requires, any term or expression which is defined in or given a      particular meaning by the provisions of the Incoterms shall have the same      meaning in this\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 9\n\nAgreement, but if there is any conflict between the provisions of the      Incoterms and this Agreement, the latter shall prevail.\n\n8.2 All risk of loss or damage to the Equipment and Software will pass to      Distributor on collection by the freight forwarder from Airspan. However,      Airspan will insure the Equipment against loss or damage in transit to the      agreed to location as set forth in the Purchase Order within the city      limits of the arrival airport as set forth in Paragraph 8.1.\n\n8.3 Title to the Equipment shall pass to Distributor on collection by the      freight forwarder from Airspan.\n\n8.4  If Distributor has any Airspan owned Equipment in its possession:\n\na.   Distributor shall ensure that Equipment is clearly marked as the      property of Airspan, and if asked, shall inform any third parties that the      Equipment is the property of Airspan;\n\nb.   Distributor shall not purport to create any security, mortgage, lien      or pledge over the Equipment, or otherwise deal with the Equipment without      Airspan's written consent;\n\n\n\n\n\nc.   In the event of any threatened seizure of the Equipment by any third      parties, and on termination or expiration of this Agreement, or any      Contract made pursuant to it, Airspan shall have the right, without      prejudice to any other remedy, to enter without prior notice any premises      and to repossess and take away or otherwise deal with the Equipment.\n\n8.5  The Software shall at all times remain the exclusive property of      Airspan, subject to the uses provided herein.\n\n8.6  Unless Distributor clearly advises Airspan to the contrary in      writing, Airspan may make partial deliveries on account of Purchase Orders.      Delay in delivery of any installment shall not relieve Distributor of its      obligation to accept said installment, provided that said delay does not      exceed sixty (60) days from Airspan's scheduled ship date and unless      Distributor has clearly advised Airspan to cancel the delayed installment      in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to its revised planned shipment      date or its actual shipment date by Airspan.\n\n8.7  Airspan will use reasonable efforts to meet Distributor's requested      delivery schedules for Equipment and Software, but Airspan reserves the      right to refuse, or delay delivery to Distributor when Distributor's credit      is impaired,\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 10\n\nwhen Distributor is delinquent in payments or fails to meet other credit or      financial requirements reasonably established by Airspan, or when      Distributor has failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n8.8  Should orders for Equipment and Software exceed Airspan's available      inventory, Airspan will allocate its available inventory and make      deliveries on a basis that Airspan deems equitable, in its sole discretion,      and without liability to Distributor on account of the method of allocation      chosen or its implementation.  In any event, Airspan shall not be liable      for any direct, indirect, consequential, or special losses or damages      (including, but not limited to, loss of income or profit and loss of data)      that may be suffered by the Distributor or by any other person for failure      to deliver or for any delay or error in delivery of Equipment or Software      for any reason whatsoever.\n\n9.   TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS.\n\n9.1  Distributor acknowledges Airspan's exclusive right, title, and interest in and to any trademarks, trade names, logos and designations which Airspan may at any time have adopted, used, or registered in the United States of America and in the Territory (the \"Trademarks\"), and will not at any time do or cause to be done any act or thing contesting or in any way impairing or tending to impair any part of said right, title, and interest.  In connection with any reference to the Trademarks, Distributor shall not in any manner represent that it has an ownership interest in the Trademarks or registration(s) thereof, and Distributor acknowledges that no action by it or on its behalf shall create in Distributor's favor any right, title, or interest in or to the Trademarks.\n\n9.2  Distributor recognizes the validity of Airspan's copyright in any written material to which Airspan shall have made a claim to copyright protection, and Distributor specifically recognizes Airspan's exclusive right to copyright protection and/or registration of any translation of any advertising, promotional, or descriptive material furnished to Distributor by Airspan.\n\n9.3  Whenever Distributor refers to the Trademarks in advertising or in any other manner to identify the products, Distributor shall clearly indicate Airspan's ownership of the Trademarks and before distributing or publishing any advertising, descriptive, or promotional materials, Distributor shall affirmatively provide Airspan with an opportunity to inspect and approve such materials.\n\n9.4  Distributor agrees that when referring to the Trademarks, it shall diligently comply with all laws pertaining to the Trademarks at any time in force in the Territory.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 11\n\n9.5  Distributor shall promptly notify Airspan of any and all infringements, imitations, illegal uses, or misuses of the Trademarks which come to Distributor's attention.  Distributor also agrees that it shall not at any time take any action in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise to prevent the infringement, imitation, illegal use, or misuse of the Trademarks, it being clearly understood by Distributor that such action falls wholly within the authority of Airspan as sole owner of the Trademarks.\n\n9.6  Distributor agrees to render to Airspan all assistance in connection with any matter pertaining to the protection of the Trademarks, whether in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise, and to make promptly available to Airspan, its Distributors, and attorneys all of Distributor's files, records, and other information pertaining to the\n\n\n\n\n\nadvertising, promotion, and sale of the Airspan Products.  All assistance requested by Distributor in this paragraph shall be at AIRSPAN's expense.  This Expense includes costs, attorneys' and consultants' fees, and reimbursement of time spent by officers, agents and employees of Distributor.\n\n9.7  Distributor agrees and undertakes that it will not at any time, whether during the term of this Agreement or after its expiration or termination, adopt, use, or register without Airspan's prior, written consent any work or symbol or combination thereof which is similar to any of the Trademarks.\n\n9.8 In the advertising and sale of Airspan Products, Distributor may use the Trademarks in relation to those Airspan Products.  Distributor will not make or permit the alteration or removal of any tags, labels, or other identifying marks placed by Airspan on Airspan Products.  Distributor will not use or give any third party permission to use the Trademarks. Distributor will not use, or give any third party permission to use, the names \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"ACL\", \"ANI\" or abbreviations or derivations thereof in Distributor's corporate titles, or in any way which might result in confusion as to Airspan and Distributor being separate and distinct entities. Distributor admits Airspan's exclusive ownership of the name \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"ANI\", \"ACL\", and any abbreviations or derivations thereof and all of Airspan's Trademarks (whether registered or not).  Distributor shall not take any action inconsistent with Airspan's ownership of such Trademarks; therefore, Distributor shall treat all of Airspan's items distinctively (as to typography) and shall only use exact reproductions of all Airspan's symbols (including Airspan's logo).   Distributor shall not adopt or use any Trademark or product name which may be confusingly similar to any Airspan Trademark.  Distributor may use the Airspan logo as it appears on Airspan's letterhead.\n\n10.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRETS.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 12\n\n10.1  In this Agreement, the term \"Confidential Information\" shall mean the information of Airspan disclosed to Distributor in connection with its performance under this Agreement, which is in written, recorded, photographic, machine-readable, or other physical form or oral information reduced to writing as soon as practicable after disclosure to Distributor, and which is conspicuously marked \"Confidential\", \"Proprietary\", \"Private\", or in any other manner indicating its confidential and/or proprietary nature.  Without limitation, Confidential Information includes:  (1) Airspan's software products, materials, data reports, programs, documentation, diagrams, and all related technical information; (2) all information relating to Airspan's business and products which is critical to Airspan's position in the marketplace, including future plans of Airspan relating to the fields of endeavor in which Distributor performs services for Airspan, the nature of certain work projects to which Distributor is exposed, and the identity of persons working on those projects; and (3) any improvements, enhancements, or modifications to the above made by or on behalf of Airspan during the performance under this Agreement which are provided, made available, or disclosed by or on behalf of Airspan to Distributor, or used by Airspan or any of Airspan's other Distributors in connection with their own sales activities.\n\n10.2  Trade secrets are confidential information that includes ideas, concepts, techniques, processes, inventions, knowledge, and know-how developed by Airspan which:  (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is subject to the efforts of Airspan that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.  (This \"trade secret\" language comes from the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.)\n\n10.3  Distributor covenants and agrees that it will use the Confidential Information solely for the performance of services under this Agreement, and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person (including Airspan employees in any other division, group, or entity), firm, or corporation.\n\n10.4  Distributor shall use the same degree of care in safeguarding the Confidential Information as it uses for its own confidential information of like importance, but no less than reasonable care.  Upon discovery of any disclosure or misuse of Confidential Information, Distributor shall endeavor to prevent any further disclosure or misuse.\n\n10.5  All Confidential Information shall remain the property of Airspan, and such Confidential Information and all copies thereof shall promptly be returned to Airspan upon request or, at Airspan 's option, destroyed, in which case Airspan shall be notified in writing when it has been destroyed.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 13\n\n10.6  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting to or conferring upon Distributor any rights, by license or otherwise, express or implied, in Airspan's Confidential Information, other than the right to use the Confidential Information for the purpose of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.7  Any copies of the Confidential Information made by Distributor shall reproduce proprietary marking and legends included therein, but the provisions of this Agreement supersede any provisions of such legends inconsistent herewith.\n\n10.8  The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be disclosed by Distributor to others, except with the prior, written consent of Airspan, or as may be required by law or as necessary to establish its rights hereunder.\n\n10.9  If, in connection with its performance, Distributor discloses to Airspan any ideas, developments, or inventions conceived or actually reduced to practice by Distributor prior to its performance hereunder, no relationship, confidential or otherwise, express or implied, is established with Airspan by the disclosure thereof.  With respect to any such disclosure, no obligation of any kind is assumed by nor may be implied against Airspan, its subsidiary, or associated companies unless a formal, separate, written contract regarding the subject of disclosure is consummated by the parties, and then the obligation shall be only as expressed in the separate contract.\n\n10.10  Distributor agrees that any breach of the provisions of this Section by Distributor or Distributor's personnel, agents, or subcontractors, or any third party providing products or services to Distributor will cause immediate and irreparable injury to Airspan and that, in the event of such breach, Airspan shall be entitled to injunctive relief and any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.\n\n10.11  After Distributor has received Airspan's Confidential Information and know-how, it will be impossible to segregate Airspan's knowledge and know- how from other knowledge acquired independently by Distributor.  Accordingly, during the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Distributor will not offer services to third parties which compete with the services provided by Airspan under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Airspan in order to compete with Airspan or its customers.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Distributor is not precluded from any activities which concern product sectors or industries other than those that concern products or services similar to those offered by Airspan in connection with this Agreement.  Nothing in this paragraph will be construed to prevent Distributor from providing service to existing customers of Distributor which would result in their interruption of service to the public.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 14\n\n10.12 During the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Airspan will not offer products or services to third parties which compete with the products or services provided by Distributor under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Distributor in order to compete with Distributor its customers\n\n10.13 The obligations of this Section 10 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n11.  SOFTWARE LICENSE.\n\n11.1 Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.  No license is granted to use the Software on multiple Systems or in conjunction with Equipment furnished by a party other than Airspan, unless specifically agreed to in writing by Airspan.  Software licensed under this Agreement is defined as: (a) any digital instruction sequence or control data contained on any media, including but not limited to, any magnetic-, electronic-, optical-, or organic device, and the term Software shall include any enhancement, modification, extension, part, portion or expansion thereof or implementation or downloading from network of any of the foregoing, for use exclusively on a System or a unit of Equipment; and (b) all associated documentation used to describe, maintain and use the Software.\n\n11.2 Any Software provided to Distributor by Airspan will be treated as the exclusive property of Airspan, and Distributor will:  (a) treat such Software as Confidential Information under Section 10 of this Agreement; (b) utilize such Software or any portions or aspects thereof (including any methods or concepts utilized therein) solely on Systems or Equipment provided by Airspan; (c) forthwith return to Airspan all memory media, documentation and/or other material that has been modified, updated or replaced; (d) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not modify, disassemble or decompile such Software, or reverse engineer any portion of the Software or functioning of Systems or Equipment, or permit others to do so, without Airspan's prior written consent; (e) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not reproduce or copy such Software in whole or in part except for backup and archival purposes or as otherwise permitted in writing by Airspan; (f) not perform or release benchmarks or other comparisons of the Software; and (g) not remove any trademark, tradename, copyright, notice or other proprietary notice from the Software and Distributor shall be responsible for the conservation of the same on any back-up copy of the Software.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 15\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3 In the event of a breach of this license by Distributor, then Airspan may, in its discretion, terminate the license with immediate effect, whereupon Distributor shall return to Airspan all Software and copies thereof within ten (10) days.\n\n12        EXCUSABLE DELAY.\n\nAirspan shall not suffer any liability for non-performance, defective performance, or late performance under this Agreement due to causes beyond its control and without its fault or negligence such as, but not limited to, acts of God, war (including civil war), civil unrest, acts of government, fire, floods, explosions, the elements, epidemics, quarantine, restrictions, strikes, lock- outs, plant shutdown, material shortages, or delays in transportation or delays of its suppliers or subcontractors for like cause.\n\nIn the event of excusable delay as defined in the preceding sentence, then Airspan, upon giving prompt written notice to Distributor, shall be excused from such performance on a day-to-day basis to the extent of such prevention, restriction, or interference (and Distributor shall likewise be excused from performance of its obligations on a day-to-day basis to the extent Distributor's obligations relate to the performance so prevented, restricted, or interfered with), provided that Airspan shall use its best endeavors to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and both parties shall proceed to perform with dispatch whenever such causes are removed or cease to exist.\n\n13.  TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n13.1  This Agreement shall remain in effect for sixty (60) months from the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). After the Initial Term, the term of the Agreement may be extended by a further period of five (5) years by mutual written agreement by the parties in the form of an amendment to this Agreement. If Distributor wishes to extend the term of the Agreement beyond the Initial Term, it  must notify Airspan in writing at least six (6) months prior to then end of the Initial Term. However, nothing contained herein shall be interpreted as requiring either party to renew or extend this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of any other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated prior to the expiration of its stated term as set forth below.\n\n13.2  Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement if  either party fails materially to comply with any covenant, term, or provision of this Agreement, by written notice given to the other party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such termination. Either party's right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 13.2 may not be exercised unless said\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 16\n\nparty shall have given the other party written notice of the failure, and the other party has not cured the failure within the thirty (30) day period following notice from said party.\n\n13.3  This Agreement terminates automatically for just cause, with no further act or action of either party if:  (a) a receiver is appointed for Distributor or its property; (b) Distributor&sbsp;makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (c) any proceedings are commenced by, for, or against Distributor under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor's relief law; or (d) Distributor is liquidated, dissolved, or otherwise terminates its activities.\n\n13.4 In the event of termination by either party for any reason, Distributor shall provide Airspan with lists of existing customers as well as other information necessary for an orderly changeover of representation in the Territory.\n\n13.5  Upon termination, Distributor shall immediately return to Airspan all Confidential Information, and Distributor agrees that neither it nor any company or organization controlled or directed by it shall divulge the contents of such material to any person at any time, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.\n\n13.6 Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor for damages of any kind, including incidental or consequential damages, on account of the termination of this agreement in accordance with this section 13.  Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor on account of termination or expiration of this Agreement for reimbursement or damages for loss of goodwill, prospective profits, or anticipated orders, or on account of any expenditures, investments, leases, or commitments made by either party, or for any other reason whatsoever based upon or growing out of such termination or expiration.  Airspan will recognize payments due to Distributor for orders received up to ninety (90) days after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n13.7  Distributor acknowledges and agrees that: (a) Distributor has no expectation and has received no assurances that its business relationship with Airspan will continue beyond the states term of this agreement or its earlier termination in accordance with this section, that any investment by Distributor in the promotion of Airspan's Products will be recovered or recouped, or that Distributor shall obtain any anticipated amount of profits by virtue of this Agreement; and (b) Distributor shall not have or acquire by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise any vested, proprietary, or other right in the promotion of Airspan's Products or in any goodwill created by its efforts hereunder.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.8  This Section 13.8, as well as the provisions of Sections 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 17\n\n14.  WARRANTY.\n\n14.1 THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 14 AND 15 OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF, AND Airspan HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED TERMS AND WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n14.2 Subject to Sections 14.3 and 14.4, Airspan warrants that the Equipment sold to Distributor under this Agreement shall, under normal use and service, be free from defects in materials and faulty workmanship, and that the Software licensed to Distributor under this Agreement shall conform in all material respects to Airspan's published specifications therefor. The warranty period for any item of Equipment and related Software shall be twelve (12) months from the date of delivery of such Equipment and related Software to Distributor as set forth in Paragraph 8.1 (hereinafter, this period of time shall be referred to as the \"Initial Warranty Period.\")\n\n14.3 Airspan's obligation and Distributor's sole remedy under this warranty are limited to the replacement or repair, at Airspan's option, of the defective Equipment or Software within the Initial Warranty Period. Airspan shall have no obligation to remedy any such defect if it can be shown that: (a) the Equipment or Software was altered, repaired, or reworked by any party other than Airspan without Airspan's prior written consent; (b) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's improper storage, mishandling, abuse, or misuse of the Equipment or Software; (c) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's use of the Equipment or Software in conjunction with equipment electronically or mechanically incompatible or of an inferior quality; or (d) the defect was the result of damage by fire, explosion, power failure, or any act of nature.\n\n14.4  In no event shall Airspan be obliged to provide on-site maintenance. Subject to the provisions of this warranty clause, defective parts or components must be returned by Distributor to Airspan's designated facility located within the contiguous 48 states in the United States, freight prepaid, within the Initial Warranty Period, and said defective parts will be repaired or replaced by Airspan at no charge to Distributor.  In connection with such return by Distributor, Distributor shall comply with Airspan's Return Material Authorization (RMA) procedures.  Risk of loss or damage to Equipment or Software returned to Airspan for repair or replacement shall be borne by Distributor until delivery to Airspan.  Upon delivery of such Equipment or Software, Airspan shall assume the risk of loss or damage until that time that the Equipment or Software being repaired or replaced is returned and delivered to Distributor. Distributor will pay all transportation costs for Equipment or Software shipped to Airspan for repair or replacement.  Airspan shall pay all transportation costs associated\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 18\n\nwith returning repaired or replaced Equipment or Software to Distributor unless there was no fault found (NFF), in which event, the Distributor shall pay such transportation costs, along with Airspan's then prevailing standard NFF charge.\n\n14.5  Airspan will charge Distributor for any maintenance carried out which is not covered by the warranties contained in Section 14.2 or Section 15 at Airspan's then prevailing standard rates for such services.\n\n15.  WARRANTY ON REPAIRED AND REPLACEMENT MATERIALS.\n\nAirspan warrants that, following repair or replacement, the repaired or replaced Equipment or Software by Airspan shall be free from defects in materials and faulty workmanship and that the Software will conform in all material respects to Airspan's published specifications therefor for ninety (90) days from date of shipment from Airspan to Distributor or until the end of the Initial Warranty Period, whichever is longer.\n\n16.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n16.1  WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO SECTION 16.4, NEITHER Airspan, NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, SHAREHOLDERS, OR AFFILIATES (Airspan AND SUCH OTHER PERSONS, THE \"Airspan PARTIES\"), SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO DISTRIBUTOR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, INCOME, REVENUE OR DATA, OR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PURCHASE ORDER PLACED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER COLLATERAL CONTRACT, OR FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE EQUIPMENT OR THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE THEREOF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THEM EITHER SEPARATELY OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER EQUIPMENT OR SOFTWARE, OR FROM ANY OTHER CAUSE, WHETHER CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY, ON GROUNDS OF FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE.\n\n16.2  Without prejudice to Sections 16.3 and 16.4, the liability of the Airspan Parties, taken as a whole, for each event or series of connected events\n\n\n\n\n\narising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any purchase order placed pursuant to this Agreement, or any other collateral contract, or from or in connection with the Equipment or Software or the use thereof, or the inability to use them either separately or in combination with other equipment or software, or from any other cause, whether caused by negligence, breach of contract, strict liability, breach of warranty, on grounds of failure of essential purpose, or otherwise, shall in no circumstance exceed the total amount payable by Distributor to Airspan under this Agreement for the provision of\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 19\n\nthe Equipment or Software which gave rise to the loss or damage or in connection with which the loss or damage was incurred.\n\n16.3  Airspan Parties, taken as a whole, shall be liable for physical damage to Distributor's property resulting from Airspan's negligence under or in connection with this Agreement up to a maximum aggregate amount of one million US Dollars (US$1,000,000).  And Distributor, taken as a whole, shall be liable for physical damage to Airspan's property resulting from Distributor's negligence under or in connection with this Agreement up to a maximum aggregate amount of one million US Dollars (US$1,000,000).\n\n16.4  Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or in any way limit Airspan liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence.\n\n16.5  Save as provided for in Section 17 Distributor shall indemnify and hold harmless and defend the Airspan Parties from and against all claims, demands, actions, suits, proceedings, writs, judgments, orders and decrees brought, made or rendered against them or any of them and all damages, losses and expenses suffered or incurred by them or any of them howsoever arising out of or related to the breach by Distributor of any of the terms of this Agreement. Airspan shall notify Distributor forthwith of any claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding, writ, judgment, order or decree falling within the scope of this Section 16.5 and shall permit Distributor sole conduct of the same and shall provide reasonable assistance in relation thereto, subject to appropriate defense by Distributor and the payment by Distributor of Airspan's reasonable costs and expenses.\n\n16.6  Distributor shall include, in its agreements with its customers pursuant to which Distributor supplies Equipment or Software, provisions pursuant to which such customers agree that the Airspan Parties shall have no liability for any of the types of damages referred to at Section 16.1 in connection with or arising from the Equipment or Software or the use thereof, or the inability to use them either separately or in combination with other equipment or software, or from any other causes.\n\n17.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INDEMNITY.\n\n17.1 Airspan agrees to indemnify and hold Distributor harmless with respect to any suit, claim, or proceeding brought against Distributor by a third party alleging that Distributor's use of the Equipment or the Software, separately or in combination, as a whole or in part, constitutes an infringement of any patent or copyright or misuse of proprietary or trade secret information.  Airspan agrees to defend Distributor against any such claims and to pay all litigation costs, reasonable attorney's fees, settlement payments, and any damages awarded or resulting from any such claim.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 20\n\n17.2 Distributor shall promptly advise Airspan of any such suit, claim, or proceeding and shall co-operate with Airspan in the defense or settlement thereof.  Airspan shall have sole control of the defense of any action involving such a claim and of all negotiations for its settlement or compromise.\n\n17.3 In the event that an injunction is obtained against Distributor's use of the Equipment and/or the Software, in whole or in part, as a result of any such claim, Airspan shall use its best efforts to either: (a) procure for Distributor the right to continue using the portions of the Equipment or the Software enjoined from use; or (b) replace or modify the same with functionally equivalent or better Equipment and/or Software so that Distributor's use is not subject to any such injunction.  In the event that Airspan cannot perform the remedies set forth in Sections 17.3(a) or 17.3(b), then Distributor shall have the right to return such Equipment and the Software to Airspan.  In the event of such return, Airspan shall refund the depreciated value of the Equipment and the license to use the Software within thirty (30) days of the receipt by Airspan of the Equipment and the Software.\n\n17.4 This indemnity shall not apply to claims arising in respect to the use of the Equipment or Software supplied by Airspan or manufactured by its suppliers in accordance with any design or any special instruction furnished by Distributor, or which is used by Distributor in a manner or for a purpose not contemplated by this Agreement.\n\n17.5 The provisions of this Section 17 set forth the entire obligation of Airspan with respect to any claim of patent infringement, copyright infringement, or misuse of proprietary or trade secret information.\n\n18.  EXPORT CONTROLS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE.\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1 If any approval with respect to this Agreement, or the registration thereof, shall be required at any time during the term of this Agreement, with respect to giving legal effect to this Agreement in the Territory, or with respect to compliance with exchange regulations or other requirements so as to assure the right of remittance abroad of United States dollars pursuant to Section 6 hereof, Distributor shall immediately take whatever steps may be necessary in this respect, and any charges incurred in connection therewith shall be for the account of Distributor.  Distributor shall keep Airspan currently informed of its efforts in this connection.  Airspan shall be under no obligation to ship Airspan Products to Distributor hereunder until Distributor has provided Airspan with satisfactory evidence that such approval or registration is not required or that it has been obtained.\n\n18.2 In the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, Distributor shall at all times strictly comply with all export laws, regulations, and orders of the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 21\n\nUnited Kingdom and the United States of America.

The meters calibration factor shall be effective only after the date of the last calibration and the  parties participating in the calibration shall issue a certificate; otherwise this shall be documented in a letter from the Transporter to the Senders.     13.3.7 Pursuant to API recommendations, testers shall be re-calibrated at least once every five years (from the date of the last calibration) o  immediately after any alteration in the measuring section.\n\n\n\n  24\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    13.3.8 The Hydrocarbon volumes that the Transporter accepts and schedules for its Transportation shall be determined by meters installed in the  nodes of Entrance and/or Exit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transporter may use alternate methods included in the API standards. If the  static measurement of tanks is used, these must have their measurement approved by the Ministry of Mines and Energy or the competent entity.  The tank measurement shall be determined following the current existing standards for such purpose.     CLAUSE 14 VOLUMETRIC COMPENSATION FOR QUALITY     14.1 The Regulations of Volumetric Compensation for Quality is an integral part of this Manual as annex 1 (MECHANISMS OF COMPENSATION  OF QUALITY FOR THE MIX OF CRUDE OILS).     14.2 Each of the Senders shall deliver to the Transporter at a Point of Entrance a Hydrocarbon volume which, and only for purposes of Volumetric  Compensation for Quality (CVC), shall be valued according to the procedure defined for the Pipeline and in accordance with its particular quality.  This quality shall be determined by an independent quantity and quality inspector accepted and recognized both by the Transporter and the  Sender.     14.3 Considering that as a result of the Transportation the Hydrocarbons delivered in the Pipeline are mixed without distinction, each Sender shall  withdraw at the Point of Exit a volume of Hydrocarbons with a different quality than its Hydrocarbon delivered, except when it has been requested  and has been accepted the Transportation of Hydrocarbons in a segregated manner. The quality of this segregated Hydrocarbon shall also be  determined by an independent quantity and quality inspector accepted and recognized both by the Transporter and the Senders. This  Hydrocarbon shall be assessed only for purposes of Volumetric Compensation for Quality and shall take into account the compensation for  quality due to the interfaces occurring when transported with other Crude Oils.     14.4 The Transporter shall apply the mechanism of Volumetric Compensation for Quality defined by the same for the Pipeline which shall have the  following main characteristics:     14.4.1 The Senders who have delivered to the Transporter Hydrocarbons with a better quality than the mixed Hydrocarbon withdrawn at the Point  of Exit of the Pipeline shall be entitled to compensation in volume, equivalent to the volumes that Senders who have delivered Hydrocarbons of  lower quality than the ones withdrawn at the Point of Exit will have to assume. For such purpose, individual qualities of all volumes delivered and  withdrawn shall be taken into account as well as the final inventories of the preceding month of Operation and the last month of Operation, with its  respective qualities.\n\n\n\n  25\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    14.4.2 The Volumetric Compensation for Quality shall be internal between the Senders in such a way that the final volumetric balances equal cero  and the Transporter shall neither charge nor Pay any volume for this purpose and shall only serve as a mediator, regulator, liquidator and  responsible for the volumetric distribution of the compensations.     14.4.3 The Volumetric Compensation for Quality is not part of the Rate and therefore shall not be compensated or will have any variation as a result  of this.     14.5 In each month of Operation the Transporter shall make a balance of the existing volumes and qualities at the beginning of the month delivered  to the Pipeline, lost, withdrawn and existing at the end of the month, both for the total of Hydrocarbons as well as for individual Hydrocarbons of  each Sender.     14.6 The Sender shall hold the Transporter and owner harmless against any cost, action, claim, intended procedures by any Third parties, losses  and all damage and obligations incurred and inherent to the mix of Hydrocarbons in the Transportation process and the Volumetric Compensation  for Quality.     14.7 In any case the Transporter may modify the mechanism of Volumetric Compensation for Quality contained herein, in the respective annexes  and all other documents in connection with the CVC.     14.8 Senders of a specific Hydrocarbon may agree with the Transporter not to apply the Volumetric Compensation for Quality to said  Hydrocarbon. The foregoing shall be applicable as long as the Hydrocarbon of other Senders is not affected negatively.     14.9 By agreement between the totality of Senders and the Transporter, it may be decided not to implement the Volumetric Compensation for  Quality (CVC) for Crude Oils transported through the system. In this case the Transporter may implement any other mechanism validated with the  Senders to carry out the volumetric balances.     CLAUSE 15 BULLETIN OF TRANSORTATION BY THE PIPELINE - BTO     15.1 The Transporter shall implement the Bulletin of Transportation by the Pipeline - BTO - which shall contain as a minimum the following  information:     15.2 Information of public access:     15.2.1 General description of the Pipeline     15.2.2 Current rates for each Distance     15.2.3 Value tables or current calculation formulas of Monetary Conditions     15.2.4 Design Capacity of the Pipeline and Nominal Capacity\n\n\n\n  26\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    15.2.5 Monthly available Capacity of the Pipeline estimated for the next (6) months and annual for the next five (5) years.     15.2.6 Excerpts of this Manual corresponding to connection requests, nomination process and minimum quality requirements of Crude Oil     15.3 Information of exclusive access for Senders and Third parties:     15.3.1 This valid Manual.     15.3.2 Discussion on modifications to the Manual     15.3.3 General information on the programmed maintenance schedule of the Pipeline and other programed activities affecting the effective Capacity  during the next six (6) months.     15.3.4 Listing of expansion projects and changes in the Pipeline's infrastructure     15.3.5 Effective Capacity confirmed for each month of Operation and estimated for the following five (5) months and the corresponding available  Capacity for each Distance.     15.3.6 Transportation program for the month of Operation and tentative for the following (5) months for each Distance     15.3.7 Description of the mechanism established by the Transporter and foreseen in the nomination process to assign the available Capacity  equitably     15.3.8 Last volumetric balance prepared for the Pipeline.     15.3.9 Daily statistics for the last month of Operation and monthly statistics since the enforcement of Resolution 181258 of 2010 from the Ministry  of Mines and Energy on the information on Effective Capacity and Volumetric Balances.     15.3.10 The annual rates and the Monetary Conditions for each Distance from the date of enforcement of Resolution 181258 of 2010 from the  Ministry of Mines and Energy.     15.4 The Transporter is no obliged to publish any information of reserved character.     15.5 The Transporter shall provide to Senders and any Third parties interested in transporting Hydrocarbons through the Pipeline as requested,  within the following ten (10) calendar days after the request and with previous verification from the Transporter of their Capacity as Sender or  Third Party an access password to the information of exclusive character referred to in numeral 15.3 of this clause. The access with a password  shall be active while the requestor maintains its Capacity as Sender or Third Party.\n\n\n\n  27\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    15.6 The Transporter shall communicate any updates, amendments or additions of relevant information in the BTO by means of electronic mail or  direct communication to the Office of Hydrocarbons of the Ministry of Mines and Energy and to all those with active access to the information of  exclusive character pursuant to the previous numeral.     CLAUSE 16 SPECIAL TRANSPORTATION CONDITIONS     16.1 The Transportation of Hydrocarbons shall be subject to the following conditions:     16.1.1 The Hydrocarbon shall be delivered by the Sender at a Point of Entrance and withdrawn at a Point of Exit.     16.1.2 The Transportation of Hydrocarbon shall be subject to performance of the conditions foreseen in the Transportation Contract, the Manual  hereof, its modifications, additions or updates, including its annexes and the applicable regulations.     16.1.3 The Transporter reserves the right to receive or reject a Hydrocarbon that fails to meet the minimum specified values; in case of reception,  the Sender shall Pay the Transporter any costs incurred in the analysis and eventual treatment of this Hydrocarbon to place it within the required  specifications or to implement the scheme required for its Transportation.     16.1.4 The Transporter reserves the right to require, reject or approve the injection at any other Point in the Pipeline of products such as corrosion  inhibitors, depressors of Point of fluidity, friction reducers or any other additive in the Hydrocarbon to be transported.

The Sender shall Pay the Transporter all costs incurred in the  analysis and eventual treatment of this Hydrocarbon to place it within the required specifications or to implement the scheme required for its  Transportation.     16.1.6 The Transporter shall be entitled, with a previous provisional notice, to remove and sell the Crude of any Sender that fails to comply with  any of the specifications at its Sole discretion. If the Transporter exercises its right of sale pursuant to this clause, the Transporter shall deduct  from the proceeds of such sale all costs incurred by the Transporter with respect to the storage, removal and sale of such Crude Oil. The  Transporter shall pay the balance to the Sender.\n\n\n\n  28\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    16.1.7 The Transporter shall not accept Crude Oil delivered by any Sender if this may cause impairment to the Pipeline of the Crudes or mixtures  transported (without consideration of whether or not the Crude Oil meets the minimum quality specifications).     16.1.8 The Transporter acting reasonably and in good faith, shall be entitled to make any changes to the minimum quality specifications of Crude  Oil in accordance with operating practices, which may be necessary or pertinent, including but without being limited to, prevent material damage or  the material degradation of the effective Capacity of the Pipeline in order to prevent any personal injuries or damage to the property or the  environment.     CLAUSE 17 REGULATIONS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF SEGREGATED HYDROCARBON     17.1 With a previous request from the Sender or Third Party, the Transporter may accept the Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon to the  extent that this is a technical and economically viable alternative. The Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon cannot change the scheme set  out in clause 10 and shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions in this Manual.     17.2 As a consequence of the foregoing, the Transporter shall inform the Sender its disposition to start the Transportation of segregated  Hydrocarbon. The Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon shall be subject to the nomination process set forth in this Manual.     17.3 Any additional charges for Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon shall be borne by the Sender or Third Party requesting the service, and  it will be taken into account, including but without being limited, any costs and damage caused to the Transporter, owner or other Senders.     CLAUSE 18 RISKS AND RESPONSIBILITY     18.1 The Transporter shall exercise custody on the Hydrocarbon from the time the Sender or whoever the Sender designates, delivers it at the Point  of Entrance and until the Point of Exit.     18.2 Neither the Transporter nor the owner shall be responsible for the consequences of failing to comply with the deliveries and withdrawals  generated by the Sender in the Transportation program, commitments of operators and/or Transporters of Transportation systems connected to  the Pipeline.\n\n\n\n  29\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    18.3 The Transporter shall not be responsible for any damage or deterioration that a Hydrocarbon delivered by a Sender may suffer, such as  contamination with strange materials, contamination by contact of different types of Hydrocarbons if the damage or deterioration is due to  Justified Events. In the event any of the cases previously mentioned occurs, and one or more Senders are involved, all the Hydrocarbons affected  shall be prorated between the Senders in proportion to the ownership of each of the Hydrocarbons involved, without prejudice of any indemnities  afterwards which may be applicable between the Senders affected. The Transporter shall prepare the information corresponding to the volume of  Hydrocarbon affected and the proportion corresponding to each Sender.     18.4 The Transporter shall be responsible for the Transportation service, for any losses, damage or deterioration that the Hydrocarbon may suffer.  The Transporter shall be released from any responsibility in the Justified Events and the Transporter is not incurring in any gross negligence.     18.5 Any damage or prejudice caused to the Transporter by virtue of failing to comply with the regulations contained in this Manual by any  Sender shall be the responsibility of the Sender who shall indemnify the Transporter for such damage or prejudice.     18.6 Hydrocarbons delivered by each Sender and transported through the Pipeline may vary in their quality as a result of the mix with other  Hydrocarbons. Except for events in which segregated Hydrocarbons are transported, the Transporter shall not have any obligation to return at the  Point of Exit a Hydrocarbon of the same quality as the Hydrocarbon delivered for its Transportation at the Point of Entrance. The adjustments of  Volumetric Compensation for Quality shall be applied to the transported mixed Hydrocarbons.     18.7 In the Transportation of Hydrocarbon mix and Hydrocarbon segregated through the Pipeline, contamination fronts are generated. All Senders  of the Pipeline shall accept as withdrawn volume, a portion of the contamination fronts generated in the Transportation through the Pipeline. If the  Sender requires some special conditions for the Transportation of a Hydrocarbon, these shall be agreed with the Transporter who reserves the  right to accept them and require the Sender to bear all costs associated to such conditions.     18.8 The following shall be considered in the Transportation of Hydrocarbon mix and Hydrocarbon segregated through the Pipeline:     18.8.1 The Hydrocarbon of higher quality with respect to the Hydrocarbon of lower quality shall always be degraded in the contamination fronts.\n\n\n\n  30\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    18.8.2 The Transporter shall estimate a maximum volume corresponding to the contamination fronts and shall be responsible to comply with this  value.     18.9 The Transporter is obliged to return the Sender and the latter to withdraw at a Point of Exit, the volume of equivalent Hydrocarbon upon  application of the mechanism of Volumetric Compensation for Quality.     18.10 The Senders and Third parties shall indemnify and hold the Transporter and the owner harmless against any costs, claims, litigations, judicial  or extra-judicial action, and decisions of any kind, which may be brought against the Transporter or owner, and in general by any procedure  intended by any Third parties.     CLAUSE 19 FILLING THE PIPELINE OR FILLING THE LINE     19.1 It is the necessary volume to fill the Pipeline between the initial pumping station and the final station, the non-pumping bottom of the storage  tanks of the Pipeline, and all installations, tubes, equipment, pumping and measuring accessories.     19.2 For the Pipeline Operation, the Transporter may request to each Sender, including the ANH, to deliver to the Transporter the necessary  quantity of Hydrocarbon to fill in the line of the Pipeline. The participation of each Sender in filling in the line shall be determined by the  Transporter based on criteria such as: Ownership of the Pipeline and Contracted Capacity.     19.3 The Transporter shall determine at its judgment the Day in which each Sender shall deliver its proportional participation in filling the line of  the Pipeline, and shall communicate the corresponding volume indicating the date of delivery.     19.4 The Hydrocarbon delivered by the Senders to fill in the line of the Pipeline shall not be withdrawn from the Pipeline without the previous  authorization from the Transporter. Without prejudice of the foregoing, the Sender shall not lose the ownership of the Hydrocarbon remaining in  the Pipeline.     19.5 When segregated Hydrocarbon is transported, it shall be understood that the ownership of the filling of the line of the Pipeline varies  according to the volumes of segregated Hydrocarbon present in the Pipeline at a given time. Without prejudice of the foregoing, the Sender shall  not lose the ownership of the segregated Hydrocarbon remaining in the Pipeline.     CLAUSE 20 HANDLING LOSSES IN THE PIPELINE     20.1 The identification and handling of losses in the Pipeline shall be carried out as follows:\n\n\n\n  31\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    20.1.1 All identifiable losses of mix or segregated Hydrocarbon not attributable to the Transporter as per numeral 18.4 shall be assumed by the  Senders of the mix or segregated Hydrocarbon according to the calculation made by the Transporter based on the Operational parameters and  formalized in the CVC. In this sense, the Senders accept the liquidation made by the Transporter.     20.1.2 The report prepared by the Transporter shall be considered as the basis to calculate the identifiable losses, indicating the Operation  conditions of that day, time, place, causes, deliveries, dispatches, withdrawals, mix or segregated Hydrocarbon, recovered and lost and determined  after the filling of the line and the restarting of the pumping.     20.1.3 Non-identifiable loses are understood only those losses during Transportation to which its cause cannot be determined with precision  throughout the process, from the Points of Entrance to the Points of Exit, including but without being limited to the following:\n\n   20.1.4 The Transporter shall calculate these losses each semester in such a manner that the semester calculation reflects the real losses occurring  during each semester. The average semester of all losses shall be up to cero Point five percent (0.5%) of the deliveries of the period. This  calculation shall be made by means of balances that the Transporter shall carry out at the beginning of each calendar month with respect to the  previous calendar month, which shall reflect the deliveries and withdrawals, the inventory movement and the identifiable losses, if there are any, to  be calculated each semester.     20.1.5 In the case of mix Hydrocarbon, the Non-identifiable Losses of the semester shall be assumed by each of the Senders at prorate of the  deliveries of the period.\n\n\n\n  \u00b7 Stops/ starts of the Pipeline    \u00b7 Illegal extractions non-detected    \u00b7 Faults in the meter factors    \u00b7 Volumetric contractions    \u00b7 Leakages/passes in the valves    \u00b7 Evaporation    \u00b7 Escapes    \u00b7 Inherent uncertainties on the measurement systems and associated instrumentation    \u00b7 Inherent uncertainties of laboratory analysis associated to the calculation of volumes    \u00b7 Propagation of inherent uncertainties of the procedures set out at the international level for the calculation of volumes by static and  dynamic measurement.    \u00b7 Handling loses inherent to the Pipeline\n\n  32\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    20.1.6 In the case of segregated Hydrocarbon, the Sender of the segregated Hydrocarbon shall assume the Non-identifiable losses of the semester.     20.1.7 In the event that Non-identifiable losses exceed cero Point five percent (0.5%) of the deliveries, calculated each semester, the Transporter  shall inquire on the possible causes in order to take the corrective actions immediately.     20.1.8 The calculation procedure of losses in the Pipeline shall be governed by the provisions in this clause and the current Compensation  Mechanism for Quality for the Mix of Crude Oil.     20.1.9 Non-identifiable losses equal or less than 0.5% monthly shall be distributed according to the value in US dollars of the deliveries by each  Sender of the calendar month in which they were detected or the calendar month in which they are reported.     20.1.10 Identifiable losses are distributed according to the value in US dollars of the deliveries by each Sender on the calendar month in which they  were detected     CLAUSE 21 CLAIMS     21.1 Any claim by a Sender or Third Party in connection with the Transportation service of Hydrocarbons shall be resolved pursuant to the  internal procedures of the Transporter and the applicable regulations. These claims shall be delivered to the Transporter's Operational area and  they shall conduct the respective internal procedure and shall communicate the result to the Sender.     21.2 For claims regarding the quantity or quality of Hydrocarbons, these shall be presented in writing at the latest within fifteen (15) calendar days  after the date of delivery or withdrawal of the Hydrocarbon or the date in which the report for the Volumetric Compensation for Quality is issued.  The claim shall be justified within the following thirty calendar days after being presented.     21.3 If the Sender does not present its claim, or if made extemporaneously, or if it is not duly and timely justified, it shall mean the acceptance by  the Sender of the Hydrocarbon delivered or withdrawn or the Volumetric Compensation by Quality, as the case may be.     CLAUSE 22 SANCTIONS TO OPERATING AGENTS FOR NON-PERFORMANCE OF THE TRANSPORTATION SCHEDULE     22.1 Each of the nominations made by Senders and Third parties shall constitute their commitment to comply with the delivery and withdrawal  schedule with quantities and flow rates previously agreed between the parties.\n\n\n\n  33\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    22.2 For the Operation of the Pipeline the following particular provisions shall be taken into account to apply the following sanctions depending  on the type of Sender:     22.2.1 Sender with Contracted Capacity in Firm:     22.2.1 If by any reason the delivery is less than 95% or more than 105% of their Scheduled Capacity, the Sender shall Pay:     22.2.1.1.1 The Transportation fee for volumes delivered when they are higher than the Contracted Capacity in firm. When they are equal or less the  Sender shall Pay Transportation fee on the Contracted Capacity in firm.     22.2.1.1.2 The Transporter may decide to charge the Sender a sanction equivalent to 5% of the Transportation Fee of the Scheduled Capacity.\n\n\n\n   22.2.1.2 If by any reason, delivery is between 95% and up to 105% of its scheduled Capacity, the Transporter shall charge the Transportation fee  for volumes delivered when these are above the Contracted Capacity in firm.

The purpose of the CVC is to establish a system to compensate Senders for the degradation or improvement of the Crude Oil withdrawn  compared with the Crude delivered. The Sender withdrawing a Crude o lower quality than the Crude delivered shall be compensated  with a higher volume. The Sender withdrawing a Crude with higher quality than the Crude delivered shall compensate others Senders of  better quality accepting a lower volume. At any rate, the sum of debits and credits by CVC for all Senders shall be cero.\n\n\n\n  1. LOSSES\n\n  2. CRUDE OIL CONSUMPTION\n\n  3. VOLUMETRIC COMPENSATION FOR QUALITY - CVC\n\n  3.1 When Crude Oils are delivered to the Pipeline of different quality and from different Senders, the result shall be a Crude Oil with  different characteristics of quality and market value than the Crude Oil delivered to the Pipeline by each of the Senders. Due to different  qualities of Crude Oil delivered to the Pipeline, some Senders shall withdraw Crude of higher value than the Oil delivered while others  shall withdraw Crude Oil with less value than the Oil delivered to the Pipeline.\n\n  40\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    At any node of Entrance of the Pipeline where two or more Crude Oil flows merge in order to be transported, a volumetric compensation  for quality shall be established on the resulting mix.\n\n   For purposes of the procedure hereof, the provisions in the Manual of the Transporter shall be applied for measurements in the  Pipeline.\n\n   The Transporter set out detailed procedures for the CVC following the guidelines established hereto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   For any month of Operation the corresponding quantity of Crude of each Sender shall be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  3.2 SAMPLING AND SYSTEM MEASUREMENT\n\n  3.3 CVC PROCEDURES\n\n  3.3.1 The Transporter shall administer the CVC process and the Senders may audit the process or request reviews thereto as long as the  Transporter is timely informed and a working plan is coordinated between the parties.\n\n  3.3.2 The Transporter shall establish monthly the coefficients for adjustments of quality and sulfur pursuant to the criteria established  herein.\n\n  3.3.3 The CVC shall be settled in kind.\n\n  3.3.4 The Transporter shall make monthly adjustments to the corresponding volume of Crude to each Sender, based on the coefficients of  adjustment for quality.\n\n  (a) Reduced if such Sender of the Pipeline delivers Crude of lower quality than the average quality of the mix,\n\n  (b) Increased if said Sender of the Pipeline delivers Crude of ah higher quality than the average quality of the mix.\n\n  3.3.5 At the latest on the 15th day of the calendar month following the Operation, Senders shall report to the Transporter the export prices,  the API gravity and the sulfur content of its Crude for the Month of Operation.\n\n  41\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   The parties may jointly review:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   The API gravity and the sulfur content on the data base of the Crude quality are representative of the current qualities of Crude  which is being delivered.     The variability of the API gravity and sulfur is within an allowed tolerance to be determined by the parties. Analyses of sulfur  content shall be conducted based on a schedule agreed by the parties after the beginning of the Fiscal Year.\n\n   By means of using the Crude Oil basket of reference the variation of price shall be determined regarding the API grade and sulfur content for Crude  Oil delivered. The method is based on the use of the linear regression of prices of a Crude Oil basket of reference delivered in the coast of the Gulf  of The United States of America with API gravity and sulfur content.\n\n\n\n  3.3.6 Each month of Operation the Transporter shall measure the volumes delivered by the Senders and shall determine the weighted  average for the quality parameters of Crude Oils delivered.\n\n  3.3.7 The Transporter shall calculate the adjustments to the volume for each Sender and shall determine the Crude volume that  corresponds. No adjustment in the volume as a consequence of the CVC shall affect the Transportation fee that a Sender shall Pay to  the Transporter.\n\n  3.3.8 Senders acknowledge that adjustments to their Crude volumes to be withdrawn as a result of these principles and procedures of the  CVC may affect the volume of Crude Oil for a withdrawal afterwards.\n\n  3.3.9 Senders are entitled to review the Transporter's calculations regarding the adjustments by CVC and the due application of this  procedure.\n\n  (a) The appropriateness of the Crude Oil reference basket regarding their terms of quality.\n\n  (b) The information on prices available to the public.\n\n  (c) The calculations of the coefficients and the volumes adjusted.\n\n  3.3.10 A data base for the API gravity shall be developed and sulfur content for Crude delivered from reliable samples of laboratory of  Crude Oil flows. The quality data of Crude Oil must comply with the following criteria:\n\n  3.4 METHODOLOGY FOR CRUDE OIL VALUATION\n\n  42\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1\n\n   The basket of Crude Oil to be used shall always include a minimum of ten (10) Crude Oils. The basket of reference for Crude Oil with prices and  qualities historically recognized shall be used to determine the coefficients of adjustment for API grade and sulfur content. The price information  of the basket shall be continuously available from sources open to the public for each Crude Oil of reference. Prices reported used in the basket of  Crude Oil of reference shall be obtained from independent price information services recognized by the industry and shall come from real  Operations.     This basket provides a range of qualities to develop the coefficients for the regressions and therefore cover the flows that may be injected to the  Pipeline. The initial basket of Crude Oils to be used is the one established in table I of this procedure which may be reviewed by common  agreement between the Transporter and the Senders.\n\n   All price quotes of Crude Oil for a common location in the Coast of the Gulf of The United States of America shall be adjusted.     All prices of Crude Oil of reference shall be adjusted with respect to the location and based on the availability of price information according to the  following list:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Tables II to IV of this procedure show examples for calculation of basket Crude prices delivered in the Gulf Coast.\n\n   To determine API gravity and sulfur coefficients linear regressions shall be run using the minimum square method.\n\n\n\n  3.4.1 BASKET OF REFERENCE FOR CRUDE OIL\n\n  3.4.2 CALCULATION OF CRUDE OIL PRICES FOR THE BASKET IN THE COAST OF THE GULF\n\n  1. FOB quotation\n\n  - Transportation to the Coast of the Gulf of The United States of America is added using the appropriate vessel size.\n\n  - Customs Tariffs, Oil pollution Liability Insurance, \"Superfund\" taxes are included and others as appropriate.\n\n  2. CIF quotation\n\n  - Customs Tariffs, Oil pollution Liability Insurance, \"Superfund\" taxes are included and others as appropriate.\n\n  3. Crude Oil delivered by the Pipeline\n\n  - Any Pipeline fee is added if necessary\n\n  - \"Superfund\" is included and other fees/tariffs as appropriate.\n\n  3.4.3 LINEAR REGRESSION FOR PRICES, GRAVITY AND SULFUR\n\n  43\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    First the arithmetic average is calculated for prices of the basket of Crude Oils of reference delivered in the Gulf coast for three months. The  cumulative average for three months shall be calculated at the closing of the settling month using the prices for the settling month and the two (2)  previous months prior to the settling month (See 1 in table V).     To determine the API gravity coefficient, a linear regression analysis shall be performed using the three months average of Crude prices from the  basket calculated in the paragraph above as the dependent variable. Likewise, the API gravity and sulfur content is used for each Crude Oil of  reference as the independent variables. The formula to be used makes a regression of the price as a function of API gravity and sulfur  simultaneously (See 2 in table V).     To determine the sulfur content a linear regression analysis shall be conducted using the three month average of Crude prices from the basket  calculated in the previous paragraph as the dependent variable. Likewise, the API gravity and sulfur content is used for each Crude Oil of  reference as the independent variables. The formula to be used makes a regression of the price as a function of API gravity and sulfur  simultaneously (See 3 in table V).     The results of the determination of the linear relation between the price delivered and the API gravity and sulfur content may be stated in the  following lineal equation:     Y = A1* X1+ B* X2 + b     Pr = A1* APIR+ B*SR + b (1)     Where:     PR = Crude price in $/Bbl     A1 = API gravity coefficient determined through linear regression in $ by grade API-Bbl     APIR = Independent variable of API gravity     B = Sulfur coefficient determined through linear regression in $/%S-Bbl (negative number)     SR = Independent variable of sulfur content     b = Y interception determined from the linear regression in $/Bbl.\n\n   After obtaining the API and sulfur coefficients, a volumetric adjustment shall be calculated to conciliate differences between the quality of each  Sender and the mix transported. The quantity to be adjusted for each Sender is determined as is follows:\n\n\n\n  3.4.3 ADJSUTMENT OF VOLUMES FOR SENDERS (TABLE VI)\n\n  44\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    The relative value of Crude Oil for each Sender shall be calculated at the Point of Entrance. To obtain this, the API gravity of Crude from each  Sender is multiplied by the API coefficient obtained in the regression and then adding to this result, the multiplication of the sulfur percentage of  Crude from each Sender by the sulfur coefficient obtained in the regression. See table VI in the column - Relative value of Crude $/BBL     The relative value of the mix transported is calculated with the data of the relative value of each Crude Oil from all Senders. This value is obtained  calculating the weighted average of the relative values of each Crude Oil multiplied by the volume delivered by the Sender. (See (1) table VI     After this, the average export price of the mix must be obtained with the data from exports of all Senders in the month in which the adjustments are  made. (See (2) in table VI     To obtain the calculated price, the difference between the relative value of each Crude Oil and the relative value calculated for mix (1) must be  obtained, and add this difference to the average export price of the mix.     Then, the quantity delivered by the Sender is multiplied by its calculated price and this product is divided between the average export price of the  mix, obtaining as a result the total adjusted volume by Sender.     The volume to be adjusted shall be the difference between the total adjusted volume by Sender and the volume delivered by a Sender to the  Pipeline.     The sum of volumes to be adjusted from all Senders must be cero.     The Transporter shall run the linear regression using a spreadsheet such as Excel. The Transporter shall document the statistical results of the  linear regression so that the information can be provided to any Sender upon request.\n\n\n\n  45\n\n\n\n\n\n  Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1   Table I     Reference Crude Basket\n\n   Table II     Illegible Information     Table III     Illegible Information     Table IV     Illegible Information\n\n\n\nDegree Origin API, \u00b0 Sulfur% Source for   Pricing  BBL/MT\n\nArab Light Saudi Arabia 33.2 1.9 Argus, Formula 7.34  Arab Medium Saudi Arabia 30.5 2.4 Argus, Formula 7.22  Arab Heavy Saudi Arabia 27.6 2.8 Argus, Formula 7.09  Castilla Colombia 18.8 2.0 Platts 6.70  LLS US Gulf Coast 36.2 0.3 Argus 7.47  Mars US Gulf Coast 28.0 2.1 Argus 7.15  Maya Mexico 21.1 3.5 Argus 6.80  Napo Ecuador 18.0 2.3 Platts 6.66  East Ecuador 24.0 1.2 Platts 6.93  Vasconia Colombia 26.5 0.9 Platts 7.04\n\n  46\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    Table V     Linear regression of prices, API gravity and sulfur - August 2010 Closing Example\n\n\n\n   Table VI     Adjustments of volumes for senders - August 2010 example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  API Sulfur JUN-2010 JUL-2010 AUG-2010 Average of   3 previous   months (1)  Arab Light 33.2 1.9 77.60 76.26 76.29 76.72  Arab Medium 30.5 2.4 75.84 74.59 74.62 75.02  Arab Heavy 27.6 2.8 74.34 73.32 73.25 73.64  Castilla 18.8 2.0 69.84 69.20 69.20 69.41  LLS 36.2 0.3 78.94 78.84 79.79 79.19  Mars 28.9 2.1 74.63 74.18 74.35 74.39  Maya 21.1 3.5 66.27 67.47 68.65 67.46  Napo 18.0 2.3 69.56 69.02 69.08 69.22  East 24.0 1.2 72.12 71.93 72.15 72.07  Vasconia 26.5 0.9 74.93 75.89 75.29 75.37\n\n(2) API, $/API-BBL Coefficient 0,495      (3) Sulfur, $%S-BBL (1,191)\n\nBank of Quality Coefficients       API Coefficient (0.50)  Sulfur Coefficient (1.19)\n\nSender Volume   injected   by sender   MBBL/mo\n\nAPI in   the   injection   point\n\nSulfur in   the   injection   point\n\nRelative  value of   the crude   S$/BBL\n\nCalculated   Price   $/BBL\n\nTotal   Volume   adjusted   by sender   MBBL/mo\n\nVolume   to adjust   MBBL/mo\n\nSender A 900 31 0.5 14.75 77.97 935 36  Sender B 1,200 26 1.0 11.69 74.90 1,195 (2)  Sender C 600 20 2.0 7.53 70.74 566 (34)  Total 2,700         2,700 -\n\n(1) Relative value calculated for mix 11.79  (2) Average price of exportation of mix, August 2012 75.00\n\n  47\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    ANNEX 2: DEFINITION OF STANDARD BARRELS PER SYSTEM\n\n\n\n\n\n  48\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    ANNEX 3: DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEMS     See File Annex 3 attached.

In those cases, ECOPETROL through the vice presidency of corporate  finance and the respective manager and/or director shall inform the Promoter if the guarantee will be made effective. Furthermore, Law 1116 of 2006  did not include the provision of the foregoing paragraph, instead, in article 43 the Law regulated the issue of real estate guarantees within the  process of insolvency, and therefore the power to make them effective was suspended, save by authorization of all creditors to wave said  limitation. Said decision shall be made with an absolute majority and included within the Agreement. Thus, the creditor may present in the  proceedings, together with its debt, the guarantee covering it and a request to make it effective, or else wait the development of the proceeding,  and if terminated by breaching, the enforceability will be then \"reactivated\".\n\n\n\nECOPETROL MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES FOR RECEIVABLES SERVICES ECP-UTE-G-008\n\n3.12 Restructuring by General Agreements.\n\n  18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Provision of services to clients with whom global payment agreements have been executed or under Law 550/99 or Law 1116/06 shall only be made  under the modality of payment in advance.

Price, Shipment and Payment 4.1. Price. The price that Sekisui shall pay for the Products shall be established separately for the Reagent Kits and for the products other than Reagent Kits. The price that Sekisui shall pay for the Reagent Kits Products shall be based upon a formula intended to ensure that Sekisui will receive 90% of the total Available Margin for all Products during the first 12 months of this Agreement, 70% of the total Available Margin for all Products during months 13-24 of this Agreement, and 65% of the total Available Margin for all Products thereafter. Accordingly, the prices (established separately for the Reagent Kits and for the products other than Reagent Kits) to be paid by Sekisui for the Products shall be fixed (subject to a later lookback true up) for each respective prospective six month period in the manner set forth in Exhibit D.

Right of First Refusal. During the Term, Sekisui shall have a right of first refusal to match the terms of any arms length, bona fide proposed Sale Transaction with a Third Party (\"Sekisui's Right of First Refusal\"). Qualigen shall provide Sekisui with at least 30 days prior written notice and access to all due diligence materials provided to any potential acquirer, such 30 day period to commence upon the notification to Sekisui that Qualigen's board of directors has approved such Proposed Sale Transaction (as set forth in a term sheet or draft definitive agreement provided to Sekisui), subject to Sekisui's Right of First Refusal. At any time during such 30 day period, Sekisui may elect to match the terms of such proposal. Sekisui will be credited in any such proposal by the cumulative amount of all Financing Payments made to date. For example, if a Third Party offers to acquire Qualigen for $50,000,000 and Sekisui has funded the full $6,200,000 of Financing Payments, Sekisui's Right of First Refusal to match the proposed transaction would be a price of $43,800,000. In the event that Sekisui elects not to move forward with such proposal for a Sale Transaction, Qualigen shall have a period of 120 days to consummate a Sale Transaction on the same terms as provided to Sekisui. If a Sale Transaction has not been consummated within such 120 days period, any Sale Transaction must once again comply with the provisions of this Section 9.3. 13\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4. Penalty for Breach. In the event of any breach of Sections 9.1 through 9.3, including without limitation, any actions by stockholders of Qualigen that result in a Sale Transaction without complying with Sections 9.1 through 9.3 above, or otherwise hinder the intent and purpose of the provisions of Sections 9.1 through 9.3 above, in addition to any other remedies available to Sekisui under the terms of this Agreement, including the right to specific performance and other equitable remedies, Sekisui shall be entitled to liquidated damages in the amount of three times any and all Financing Payments made to date. For the avoidance of doubt, this clause does not apply to a failure of the stockholders of Qualigen to approve a Sale Transaction proposed by Sekisui, so long as such stockholders did not approve a Sale Transaction on the same terms with a Third Party during the Term. 9.5. Molecular Clinical Diagnostics. In furtherance of the foregoing, during the Exclusivity Period, Qualigen shall, in consultation with Sekisui, take commercially reasonable steps to seek to regain any rights in any Qualigen molecular clinical diagnostic product technology that Qualigen has previously granted to Gen-Probe, Hologic, or any of their affiliates. 10. Representations and Warranties 10.1. By Qualigen. Qualigen hereby represents, warrants and covenants that: (a) Qualigen has the full right, power and corporate authority to enter into this Agreement, and to make the promises set forth in this Agreement, and to grant the rights herein, and that there are no outstanding agreements, assignments or encumbrances in existence inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement and that this Agreement is enforceable against Qualigen.

(c) As of the Effective Date, Qualigen has not been notified with respect to, and to Qualigen's best knowledge there is no patent infringement action pending before any court or governmental agency or other tribunal relating to any Product. (d) As of the Effective Date, Qualigen has not been notified with respect to, and to Qualigen's best knowledge no material actions are pending before any court or governmental agency or other tribunal relating to any Product. (e) All Product delivered to Sekisui or Sekisui's customers pursuant to this Agreement, at the time of such delivery, shall not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of any applicable law, regulation or guideline effective at the time of delivery and shall not be an article which may not be introduced into interstate commerce under any applicable law, regulation or guideline. 14\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) The manufacturing facilities and processes utilized for the manufacture of each Product shall comply with applicable FDA regulations including, without limitation, applicable current Good Manufacturing Practices as described in 21 CFR 820. Qualigen does not represent, warrant or covenant that the Development Plan will be successfully accomplished, that the Development Plan will produce any particular results or any favorable results, that the Development Plan will result in any Development IP (or in any valuable Development IP), that the Products (if any) arising from the Development Plan can ever receive Regulatory Approvals or be successfully or profitably commercialized, or that any other current or future Products can be successfully or profitably commercialized by Sekisui. Moreover, Sekisui acknowledges and accepts the risks inherent in attempting to develop and commercialize any medical product. There is no implied representation that any Products can be successfully developed or commercialized. Qualigen shall provide to Sekisui and for the benefit of Sekisui's customers of Products a standard commercial written warranty that the Products will be free of defects in materials or workmanship starting from the date the Product has been received by Sekisui's customer and ending after the length of time stated for the applicable Product on Exhibit D hereto (the \"User Warranty\"). The User Warranty is contingent upon proper use of a Product in the application for which such Product was intended and does not cover Products that were altered or modified (or added to or subtracted from), that were used after the expiration date thereon or that were subjected by the carrier, distributor or the customer to abuse, mishandling or unusual physical, thermal, chemical or electrical stress. 10.2. By Sekisui. Sekisui represents, warrants and covenants that: (a) Sekisui has the full right, power and corporate authority to enter into this Agreement and to make the promises set forth in this Agreement and that there are no outstanding agreements, assignments or encumbrances in existence inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement and that this Agreement is enforceable against Sekisui. (b) As of the Effective Date, Sekisui has not been notified in writing with respect to, nor is there, to Sekisui's best knowledge, any patent infringement action pending before any court or governmental agency or other tribunal relating to Sekisui's sale or distribution of the Products. (c) As of the Effective Date, Sekisui has not been notified in writing with respect to, nor is there, to Sekisui's best knowledge, any action pending preventing Sekisui from selling and distributing the Products in the Territory. (d) Sekisui shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain before distribution of each Product, all licenses, registrations and permits required to enable Sekisui to act as a distributor of such Product in the Territory. (e) Sekisui shall not make, or advise its customers to make, any alterations or modifications to, or any additions to or subtractions from, any Product. (f) Sekisui shall make no attempt to reverse-engineer any Product nor encourage or assist anyone else to do so. 15\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.

The express warranties set forth in this Section 10 and elsewhere in this Agreement are provided in lieu of, and EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS, all other warranties, express and implied, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY OTHER WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, TO THE OTHER PARTY WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS OR THE OTHER SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY EXCLUDE ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR OF MERCHANTABILITY. Each Party's representations, warranties and/or covenants under this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Party and may be asserted only by the other Party and not by anyone else (including without limitation any customer of the other Party; provide, however, that end user customers may assert the User Warranty against Qualigen). 11. Indemnities 11.1. Indemnification by Sekisui. Sekisui shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Qualigen, and its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the \"Qualigen Indemnitees\") from and against any and all claims, suits and proceedings by a Third Party (individually and collectively, \"Claims\"), and any and all losses, obligations, damages, deficiencies, costs, penalties, liabilities, assessments, judgments, amounts paid in settlement, fines and expenses (including court costs and reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys), incurred in the investigation, defense and/or settlement of any Claims (individually and collectively, \"Losses\"; it being expressly understood, however, that incidental, special, indirect and consequential damages and lost profits, lost savings and interruptions of business are expressly excluded therefrom and from such defined term): (a) arising out of the negligence or willful misconduct of Sekisui or its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives in the performance of Sekisui's obligations under this Agreement; or (b) arising out of or in connection with a breach or violation by Sekisui or its subdistributor of any applicable law or a material breach by Sekisui of any of its obligations under this Agreement, including any representations or warranties set forth herein; provided, however, that Sekisui shall have no liability or obligation to any Qualigen Indemnitee for any Claims or Losses to the extent that such Claims or Losses are primarily caused by a Qualigen Indemnitee's breach of applicable law, breach of this Agreement, negligence or willful misconduct. 11.2. Indemnification by Qualigen. Qualigen shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sekisui and its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the \"Sekisui Indemnitees\") from and against any and all Losses incurred in the investigation, defense and/ or settlement of any Claims: (a) related to bodily injury, death or property damage directly caused by any Product which has not been altered or modified (or added to or subtracted from) in any way, has been handled, stored, transported and used in accordance with Qualigen's guidelines and has not been used after its expiration date or subjected to abuse, mishandling or unusual physical, thermal, chemical or electrical stress; (b) arising out of the negligence or willful misconduct of Qualigen or its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives; (c) arising out of a breach or violation by Qualigen of any applicable law or a material breach by Qualigen of any of its obligations under this Agreement, including any representations or warranties set forth herein; or (d) arising out of any claim that any of the manufacture, marketing, import, offer for sale, sale, or use of any Product infringes upon any patent, proprietary, or intellectual property right of any Third Party in the Territory; provided, however, that Qualigen shall have no liability or obligation to any Sekisui Indemnitee for any Claims or Losses to the extent that such Claims or Losses are primarily caused by a Sekisui Indemnitee's (or any other entity or person within the Sekisui corporate family's) breach of applicable law, breach of this Agreement, negligence or willful misconduct. 16\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3. Patent Indemnity. Qualigen and Sekisui shall notify each other promptly in writing of any action (and all prior claims relating to such action) brought against Qualigen or Sekisui alleging that the manufacture, marketing, import, offer for sale, sale or use of a Product constitute infringement of the intellectual property rights of a Third Party, and (provided that such a Claim does not arise from Sekisui's noncompliance with Sections 3.6, 8.4, 10.2(b), 10.2(c), 10.2(e) or 10.2(f) of this Agreement (e.g., Sekisui has altered a Product or has used a Sekisui trademark in connection with a Product)) Qualigen agrees to defend Sekisui in such action at its expense and shall pay any costs or damages finally awarded against Sekisui in any such action; provided, that Qualigen shall have had sole control of the defense of any such action and all negotiations for its settlement or compromise and provided further that no settlement or compromise shall be binding on a Party hereto without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event a lawsuit is filed against Sekisui or Qualigen alleging that the manufacture, marketing, import, offer for sale, sale or use of a Product constitute infringement of the intellectual property rights of a Third Party, or Qualigen files an action for declaratory judgment because of a serious threat of such a lawsuit, or if in Qualigen's reasonable business judgment a Product is likely to become the subject of a claim of infringement of a patent or other intellectual property right; then Qualigen may, at its expense, and may request Sekisui's assistance to, attempt to obtain a license to such patent or other intellectual property right. 11.4. Indemnification Procedures. The Party or other Indemnitee intending to claim indemnification under this Section 11 (an \"Indemnified Party\") shall promptly notify the other Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") of any Claim in respect of which the Indemnified Party intends to claim such indemnification (provided, that no delay or deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability or obligation under this Agreement except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual prejudice directly caused by the delay or other deficiency), and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof (with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) whether or not such Claim is rightfully brought; provided, however, that an Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel and participate in the defense thereof, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the Indemnified Party, unless the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense or unless a representation of both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to the actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be required to pay for more than one separate counsel no matter the number or circumstances of all Indemnified Parties. If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to timely assume the defense of and reasonably defend such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain or assume control of such defense and the Indemnifying Party shall pay (as incurred and on demand) the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party and all other expenses of investigation and litigation. The Indemnified Party, and its directors, officers, advisers, agents and employees, shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its legal representatives in the investigations of any Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the indemnification of any Claim settled (or resolved by consent to the entry of judgment) without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party. Also, if the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle such Claim; provided, that the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of (or resolving by consent to the entry of judgment upon) such Claim unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person or entity by an Indemnified Party, no requirement that the Indemnified Party admit fault or culpability, and no adverse effect on any other claims that may be made by or against the Indemnified Party and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and such settlement does not require the Indemnified Party to take (or refrain from taking) any action. 17\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of who controls the defense, the other Party hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the defense as may be requested. Without limitation, the Party hereto which is not the Indemnifying Party and (if different) the Indemnified Party, and their respective directors, officers, advisers, agents and employees, shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its legal representatives in the investigation and defense of any Claim. 11.5. Expenses of Enforcement. As the Parties intend complete indemnification, all costs and expenses of enforcing any provision of this Section 11 shall also be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party except as otherwise set forth in Section 11.4. 11.6. Insurance. Qualigen, at its own expense, shall procure and maintain during the Term, insurance policies with the minimum coverages set forth below (\"Insurance\"). Sekisui shall be named as an additional insured with respect to the Insurance. The Insurance shall be primary for all purposes to other insurance coverage, whether such other insurance is stated to be primary, contributory, excess, contingent or otherwise, without recourse to or contribution from any Sekisui-owned coverage. (a) Commercial General Liability Insurance - Combined single limit for bodily and property damage of not less than $1,000,000 for each occurrence and $2,000,000 annual aggregate providing: \u25cf Assault and Battery coverage, \u25cf Broad form property damage coverage, \u25cf Broad form contractual liability coverage, \u25cf Products and completed operations coverage, and \u25cf Personal and advertising injury coverage. (b) Workers' Compensation and Employer's Liability Insurance - With limits of liability for: \u25cf Workers' compensation as required by statute; \u25cf Employer's liability for bodily injury by accident: $500,000 each accident; bodily injury by disease: $500,000 policy limit; and bodily injury by disease: $500,000 each employee. All Qualigen's Insurance shall be placed with an insurer that (a) has an A.M. Best rating of A- or better or (b) is a qualified self- insurance program that is approved by Sekisui. Qualigen shall provide Sekisui, upon request, with written evidence of the Insurance, including where it is provided through qualified self-insurance. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to limit Qualigen's responsibility to the amounts stated above or to any limits of Qualigen's insurance policies. 12. Regulatory Matters 12.1. Regulatory Approval. Qualigen shall be responsible for maintaining, at its sole cost, the Regulatory Approvals required for the marketing and sale of the Products in the Applicable Markets. Qualigen shall hold in its name all Regulatory Approvals required for the marketing and sale of the Products in a country or region and shall (to the extent commercially reasonable to do so) maintain in good standing all existing Regulatory Approvals. Qualigen and Sekisui shall provide reasonable advice and assistance to each other as may be necessary to maintain required Regulatory Approvals. In addition, Qualigen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Regulatory Approval for any additional territories upon Sekisui's commercially reasonable request. 18\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2. Distribution Approvals. Sekisui shall be responsible for seeking, obtaining and maintaining (i) all licenses, registrations and permits (excluding patents) required to be obtained by Sekisui to enable Sekisui to act as a distributor of the Product pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) all approvals from the Regulatory Authorities regarding marketing and advertising materials to be used by Sekisui to promote the Product. Qualigen shall cooperate with Sekisui in making and maintaining all filings that may be necessary or desirable in connection with obtaining and maintaining any regulatory approvals necessary for Sekisui to act as a distributor of the Product in the Applicable Markets. 12.3. Communication With Agencies. In the Applicable Markets, Qualigen shall have responsibility for communications with the Regulatory Authorities concerning any required Regulatory Approvals, approval of Product related marketing and advertising materials, and Product quality matters. 12.4. Governmental Warnings. Each Party shall advise the other Party promptly (but in any event within no more than 48 hours) of any warning (including any FDA Form 483), citation, indictment, claim, lawsuit, or proceeding issued or instituted by any federal, state or local governmental entity or agency against the Party, or of any revocation of any license or permit if, and only to the extent that, the manufacture, storage, or handling of the Product, or the marketing, selling, promotion or distribution of the Product, is affected. 12.5. Adverse Events, Recalls and Field Corrections. Qualigen shall have responsibility to determine whether any Adverse Events, Recalls or Field Corrections information must be reported to the FDA (under United States law) or any other Regulatory Authorities and Qualigen shall have responsibility to prepare and submit notification of Adverse Events, Recalls and/or Field Corrections to respective Regulatory Authorities for the Products. Qualigen shall provide prompt notice to Sekisui of any Adverse Events, Recalls or Field Corrections, which notice shall in any event be delivered within no more than 3 business days from Qualigen learning of such occurrence. 12.6. Complaints. Qualigen shall receive, investigate in a timely manner, and as appropriate, resolve customer complaints in the Territory. If an investigation is needed in response to a complaint or inquiry related to the Product, Qualigen shall perform the investigation and shall bear the cost of such investigation. The documentation of such investigation shall include, but not be limited to, investigation results, cause analysis, corrective and preventative action and health hazard/medical assessment, as appropriate. In the event a Product is returned by a customer for investigation, Qualigen shall ship a replacement Product to the customer. (Provided, that if a request for a return of Product is due to a change of mind over using the Product or the Sekisui customer has overstocked the product, rather than due to a warranty issue, Qualigen need not accept the return or provide any replacement or substitute.) Qualigen shall retain records of all Product related complaints, or Adverse Events for a period of not less than five (5) years beyond the expiration date of the Product or for such longer period as may be required by applicable law. Qualigen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all complaints are appropriately closed within 90 days or less from the receipt of such complaint. 19\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n12.7. Product Recalls. In the event that (i) any Applicable Market governmental agency or authority issues a request or directive or orders that the Products be recalled or retrieved, (ii) an Applicable Market court of competent jurisdiction orders that the Products be recalled or retrieved, or (iii) Qualigen and Sekisui reasonably determine, after mutual consultation, that the Products should be recalled, corrected or retrieved in any particular country or countries, Qualigen and/or Sekisui shall conduct such activity and the parties shall take all appropriate corrective actions and shall execute the steps detailed in the recall strategy. Qualigen shall be responsible for the content of any communication to the customers regarding any Recall or Field Correction. In the event such action results from Sekisui's gross negligence or willful misconduct, Sekisui shall be responsible for the expenses thereof. Otherwise, Qualigen shall be responsible for the expenses of the action. Sekisui and Qualigen shall cooperate fully with one another in conducting any such action. Sekisui shall destroy units of Products lawfully recalled only upon Qualigen's (or any governmental authority's) written instruction to destroy such units of Products, and only then in accordance with Qualigen's procedures and instructions. Otherwise, Sekisui shall return the recalled units of Product to Qualigen in accordance with Qualigen's procedures and instructions after completion of the action. 12.8. European Union Vigilance and Canada Mandatory Problem Reporting. In the event that Qualigen receives any Potentially Serious Complaints regarding the Products from a customer located in the European Union or Canada, then Qualigen shall notify Sekisui promptly, but in any event within no more than (3) business days. If Qualigen receives a complaint from any Competent Authority or Health Canada with regard to the Products, Qualigen shall notify Sekisui promptly, but in any event within no more than 48 hours. Qualigen shall have the responsibility to correspond with the Competent Authority or Health Canada, as the Authorized Representative or Regulatory Correspondent, regarding any such complaints. If corrective actions are required, the cost of the corrective action shall be borne by Qualigen up to the extent such complaint is related to the manufacturing of the Products by Qualigen, or some other cause or event attributable to Qualigen, and shall be borne by Sekisui up to the extent such complaint is due to some other cause or event attributable to Sekisui. 20\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Confidential Information; Audit Rights 13.1. Confidentiality Obligation. It is contemplated that in the course of the performance of this Agreement each Party may, from time to time, disclose proprietary and confidential information to the other (\"Confidential Information\"). Except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed to in writing, during the Term and for a period of five (5) years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the receiving Party shall disclose the other Party's Confidential Information only to its own (or its Affiliates') officers, employees, consultants, Third Party service providers, attorneys, accountants, agents, bankers, lenders, prospective lenders and prospective equity investors, and in each case only if and to the extent necessary to carry out their respective responsibilities under this Agreement or in accordance with the exercise of their rights under this Agreement or in accordance with customary permitted practice (such as to seek or maintain financing or credit), and such disclosure shall be limited to the maximum extent possible consistent with such responsibilities and rights. Except as set forth in the foregoing sentence, neither Party shall disclose Confidential Information of the other to any Third Party without the other's prior written consent. In all events, however, any and all disclosure to a Third Party (or to any such Affiliate) shall be pursuant to the terms of a non-disclosure/nonuse agreement no less restrictive than this Section 13 (or, in the case of attorneys, to a duty and obligation of nondisclosure/nonuse pursuant to the applicable rules of the profession). The Party which disclosed Confidential Information of the other to any Third Party (or to any such Affiliate) shall be responsible and liable for any disclosure or use by such Third Party or Affiliate (or its disclosees) which would have violated this Agreement if committed by the Party itself. Neither Party shall use Confidential Information of the other except as expressly allowed by and for the purposes of this Agreement or in accordance with the exercise of their rights under this Agreement or in accordance with customary permitted practice (such as to seek or maintain financing or credit) or and, after the Term, by Qualigen only to the extent required to continue to offer and provide goods and services to former Sekisui customers of Products. Each Party shall take such action to preserve the confidentiality of each other's Confidential Information as it would customarily take to preserve the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information (but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care). Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, each Party, upon the other's request, promptly shall return or destroy all the Confidential Information disclosed to the other Party pursuant to this Agreement, including all copies, reflections, analyses and extracts of documents, except for one archival copy (and such electronic copies that exist as part of the Party's computer systems, network storage systems and electronic backup systems) of such materials solely to be able to monitor its obligations that survive under this Agreement. The non-use and non-disclosure obligations set forth in this Section 13 shall not apply to any Confidential Information, or portion thereof, that the receiving Party can demonstrate: (a) is at the time of disclosure in the public domain; 21\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) after disclosure, becomes part of the public domain, by publication or otherwise, through no fault of and or without violation of any duty of confidentiality of the receiving Party or its disclosees; (c) at the time of disclosure is already in the receiving Party's possession with no duty of confidentiality, and such prior possession can be demonstrated by the receiving Party by written proof (provided that this subsection shall not apply to Confidential Information exchanged between the Parties before the execution of this Agreement that was subject to a confidentiality obligation at the time of such disclosure); (d) is rightfully received by the receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from an independent Third Party without obligation of confidentiality; provided, however, that to the receiving Party's best knowledge, such information was not obtained by said Third Party, directly or indirectly, from the disclosing Party; or (e) is independently developed by or expressly for the receiving Party, in either case solely by personnel without any access to or use of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information, as shown by receiving Party's contemporaneous written records. In the event either Party must disclose the other Party's Confidential Information in order to comply with applicable governmental regulations or as otherwise required by law or judicial process, such Party shall give reasonable advance notice to the other Party of such proposed disclosure in order that the non-disclosing Party may intercede and oppose such process, and shall use its best efforts to secure a protective order or confidential-treatment order preventing or limiting (to the greatest possible extent and for the longest possible period) the disclosure and/or requiring that the Confidential Information so disclosed be used only for the purposes for which the law or regulation required, or for which the order was issued. The Parties acknowledge that the defined term \"Confidential Information\" shall include not only a disclosing Party's own Confidential Information but also Confidential Information of an Affiliate or of a Third Party which is in the possession of a disclosing Party. However, both Parties agree not to disclose to the other Party any Confidential Information of a Third Party which is in the possession of such Party, unless the other Party has given an express prior written consent (which specifies the owner of such Confidential Information) to receive such particular Confidential Information. 22\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other agreement between Sekisui and Qualigen, nothing in this Agreement or any other agreement between the Parties prohibits, or is intended in any manner to prohibit, either Sekisui or Qualigen from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Congress, and any agency Inspector General, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. Sekisui and Qualigen do not need the prior authorization of anyone at the other Party or the other Party's legal counsel to make any such reports or disclosures and they are not required to notify the other Party that it has made such reports or disclosures. 13.2. Use of Names. During the Term, Sekisui is hereby permitted to use the Qualigen name and any Qualigen content (including the content of any existing sales collateral and marketing materials) in any sales collateral, marketing materials or other communications used in connection with the marketing and sales of the Product with the prior written consent of Qualigen, which consent shall not be reasonably withheld or delayed. Other than as provided in the foregoing sentence or to the extent such use is based on a public disclosure previously made by the other Party, during the Term neither Qualigen nor Sekisui shall use the name of the other in any verbal or written communications with any Third Party, except as allowed or contemplated herein, without the prior written consent of the other Party. 13.3. Press Releases. Neither Party shall make any press release or other similar public announcement concerning this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event such disclosure or public announcement is required to be made on a more immediate basis to comply with applicable laws, then approval will be deemed granted if no response is received from the non-disclosing Party within the time frames required by law; provided, however, that the disclosing Party provides the non-disclosing Party with notice of the legally required time frame for the approval of the disclosure. Neither Party shall use the trademark or logo of the other Party, its Affiliates or their respective employee(s) in any publicity, promotion, news release or public disclosure relating to this Agreement or its subject matter, except as may be required by law or except with the prior express written permission of such other Party, such permission not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, or except in Sekisui's advertisement, promotion and sale of the Products in compliance with this Agreement in the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding the above, once a public disclosure has been made, either Party shall be free to disclose to Third Parties any information contained in said public disclosure, without further pre-review or pre-approval. 13.4. Audit Rights. Each Party shall keep accurate books and records in sufficient detail to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations and this Agreement and enable the other Party to determine the correctness of any report made under this Agreement and monitor compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and this Agreement through the process below. Upon reasonable written notice (and no more often than once every 150 days), the auditing Party shall have the right, during normal business hours, to audit the books and records maintained by the audited Party pursuant to this Agreement to ensure the accuracy of all reports and payments made hereunder. 23\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n14. Termination 14.1. Termination by Either Party. Either Party may terminate this Agreement (i) immediately upon written notice in the event of the closing of a Sale Transaction; or (ii) immediately upon written notice if the other files a voluntary bankruptcy petition or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or becomes subject to any order for relief or involuntary bankruptcy petition under any bankruptcy, liquidation, insolvency or similar law which is not dismissed within 60 days. 14.2. Termination by Qualigen. Qualigen may terminate this Agreement (i) upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in the event of any failure of Sekisui to make a Financing Payment that is determined to be due, which failure is not cured within such 30 day period, or (ii) upon sixty (60) days prior written notice in the event of any material breach of the diligence obligations (which is understood not to include failing to meet forecasts for sales to customers) set forth in the Business Plan (as it may be amended by the Parties from time to time), which breach is not cured within such 60 day period. 14.3. Termination by Sekisui. Sekisui may terminate this Agreement upon prior written notice (i) in the event of any failure of Qualigen to meet a milestone set forth in the Development Plan (as it may be amended by the Parties from time to time), or (ii) at any other time upon ninety (90) days' prior written notice of impending termination. 14.4. Effect of Termination. Sections 4.6, 5.5, 8.1, 8.2, 11.1-11.4, 13, 14.4 and 15 shall survive the later of the expiration or termination of the Term. In addition, all provisions that survive termination, that are irrevocable or that arise due to termination shall survive in accordance with their terms. Any other provisions of this Agreement contemplated by their terms to pertain to a period of time following termination or expiration of this Agreement shall survive only for the specified period of time. Upon the expiration or termination of the Term, (i) Sekisui shall cooperate in permitting Qualigen to offer to rehire any Sekisui sales representatives who are primarily responsible for selling the Products as set forth in Section 4.6, (ii) Sekisui shall transfer to Qualigen the ownership of any Sekisui Instruments (subject to reimbursement from Qualigen for the book value (original cost less depreciation) of such Sekisui Instruments), (iii) Qualigen shall reimburse Sekisui for a prorated portion of all prepaid distribution fees paid by Sekisui during the final year of this Agreement to subdistributors, (iv) Sekisui shall assign to Qualigen each subdistributor agreement which Qualigen requests be assigned to Qualigen, and (v) each Party shall remain liable for its obligations accrued before the effective date of such expiration or termination (and for avoidance of doubt: upon expiration or termination Sekisui shall remain liable to pay Qualigen all Financing Payments then due under the Development Plan based upon the milestones that Qualigen has completed by the date of such expiration or termination). In the event there are unfulfilled orders for Products outstanding as of termination of this Agreement, Sekisui may, at its option, cancel such orders upon notice to Qualigen (in which case Qualigen agrees to fill such orders to Sekisui's end customers directly unless such customer chooses to cancel such order) or cause Qualigen to fulfill such orders and invoice Sekisui for amounts owed with respect thereto. If either Party is aware of an impending expiration or termination of the Term, it shall conduct its business with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement in the ordinary course (and not otherwise than in the ordinary course) for the duration of the Term. 24\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Miscellaneous 15.1. Independent Contractor. For the purpose of the Agreement each Party shall be, and shall be deemed to be, an independent contractor and not an agent, partner, joint venturer or employee of the other Party. Neither Party shall have authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action which shall be binding on the other Party (except as may be explicitly provided for herein or authorized in writing), and each Party agrees not to purport to do so. 15.2. Assignment. The Agreement shall not be assigned and is not assignable or delegable by either Party without the written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that Sekisui and Qualigen each may assign this Agreement without the consent of the other to a successor in connection with the merger, consolidation or sale of such Party or of all or substantially all of its assets or the portion of its business to which this Agreement relates. 15.3. No Waiver. Failure of either Party to enforce (or reasonable delay in enforcing) a right under this Agreement shall not act as a waiver of that right or the ability to later assert that right relative to the particular situation involved or to terminate this Agreement arising out of any subsequent default or breach. A waiver by a Party of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement in any instance shall not be deemed or construed to be a waiver of such term or condition for the future, or of any other term or condition hereof. 15.4. Severability. This Agreement is divisible and separable. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a final and binding court judgment (for which no further appeal is possible) to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable to any extent, such provision shall not be not affected or impaired up to the limits of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability; the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired in any way; and the affected provision shall (if at all possible) be construed as if it had been written in such a way as to both be valid, legal and enforceable and to achieve, to the greatest lawful extent, the evident economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision (or portion of provision). 15.5. Notices. All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and made (i) if by personal delivery, on the date of such delivery, (ii) if by recognized overnight courier specifying next-business-day delivery, on the next business day after the date of deposit with such courier (by the courier's stated time for enabling next-business-day delivery), (iii) if by email, on the date sent by email if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, and on the next business day if sent after normal business hours of the recipient, and (iv) if by US registered mail, on the fifth business day following such mailing in the US, in each case addressed at the address shown below for, or such other address as may be designated by 10 days' advance written notice hereunder by, such Party.

Entire Agreement and Modification. The Agreement, including the Exhibits thereto, constitutes the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels any previous or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, whether oral, written or implied, heretofore in effect, including any letter of intent, and sets forth the entire agreement between Sekisui and Qualigen with respect to the subject matter hereof (provided, that any and all previous nondisclosure/nonuse obligations, including the July 7, 2015 Confidential Disclosure Agreement) are not superseded and remain in full force and effect for all disclosures made prior to the date of this Agreement). Each Party acknowledges that it has not relied, in deciding whether to enter into this Agreement on this Agreement's expressly stated terms and conditions, on any representations, warranties, agreements, commitments or promises which are not expressly set forth within this Agreement. No agreements amending, altering, supplementing or waiving the terms hereof may be made except by the express terms of a written document signed by duly authorized representatives of the Parties. 15.7. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to its conflicts of laws principles. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall be inapplicable to this Agreement. 15.8. Attorney Fees. If litigation becomes necessary to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, the successful Party shall be entitled to recover from the other Party reasonable expenses, including attorneys' and other professional fees, in addition to any other available remedies. 26\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n15.9. Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are in no way intended to describe, interpret, define or limit the scope, extent or intent of this Agreement or any provision hereof. 15.10. Counterparts; Delivery. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Signatures to this Agreement may be delivered by email attachment or other electronic transmission, and such signatures and such delivery shall be fully effective and binding on the Party sending the same. 15.11. Further Assurances. Each Party covenants and agrees to, without the necessity of any further consideration, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such further or other documents and instruments and take any such further or other action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement. 15.12. Force Majeure. No Party shall be liable to any other Party or be deemed to have breached or defaulted under this Agreement for failure or delay in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than obligations for the payment of money) for the time and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts of God, earthquake, riot, civil commotion, terrorism, war, strikes or other labor disputes, fire, flood, failure or delay of transportation, omissions or delays in acting by a governmental authority, acts of a government or an agency thereof or judicial orders or decrees or restrictions or any other like reason which is beyond the control of the respective Party. The Party affected by force majeure shall provide the other Party with full particulars thereof as soon as it becomes aware of the same (including its best estimate of the likely extent and duration of the interference with its activities), and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to overcome the difficulties created thereby and to resume performance of its obligations hereunder as soon as practicable, and the time for performance shall be extended for a number of days equal to the duration of the force majeure. 15.13. Equitable Relief. Each Party recognizes that the covenants and agreements herein and their continued performance as set forth in this Agreement are necessary and critical to protect the legitimate interests of the other Party, that the other Party would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of such covenants and agreements and the assurance of continued performance as set forth in this Agreement, and that a Party's breach or threatened breach of such covenants and agreements will cause the opposed Party irreparable harm and significant injury, the amount of which will be extremely difficult to estimate and ascertain, thus making any remedy at law or in damages inadequate. Therefore, each Party agrees that an opposed Party shall be entitled to specific performance, an order restraining any breach or threatened breach of Section 13 and all other provisions of this Agreement, and any other equitable relief (including but not limited to temporary, preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief), without the necessity of posting of any bond or security. This right shall be in addition to and not exclusive of any other remedy available to such other Party at law or in equity. 15.14. Rights and Remedies are Cumulative. Except to the extent as may be expressly set forth herein, all rights, remedies, undertakings, obligations and agreements contained in or available upon violation of this Agreement shall be cumulative and none of them shall be in limitation of any other remedy or right authorized in law or in equity, or any undertaking, obligation or agreement of the applicable Party. 27\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n15.15. Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly set forth in Section 11, the terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each Party hereto and their respective successors or permitted assigns and it is not the intention of the Parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person. 15.16. No Implied License. No right or license is granted to Sekisui by implication, estoppel, or otherwise to any know-how, patent or other intellectual property right owned or controlled by Qualigen. 15.17. Exhibits.

Actual 'Gross to Net' (GTN) Adjustments - consist of: a) discounts, refunds, rebates, sub distributor \"channel\" fees, chargebacks, retroactive price adjustments, and any other allowances given and taken which effectively reduce the net selling price (other than such which have already diminished the gross amount invoiced), including, without limitation, volume discounts. b) Product returns and allowances Net Revenue - Actual Gross Revenue less Actual GTN Adjustments Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Components of COGS include: Actual Material Costs - Consists of: \u25cf Qualigen Bill of Material (BOM) Standard Costs (for instrument, reagent kit and related consumable products sold by Sekisui): \u25cb raw materials \u25cb component materials \u25cb packaging materials \u25cf Allocated standard shipping material costs, including envirocoolers, shipping boxes and filler materials \u25cf Actual cost of ice packs \u25cf Actual outbound freight expense (as applicable based on shipping terms) for sales and rentals of instruments, and sales of reagents and related consumables. Exhibit A-1\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Qualigen records costs of raw material, component, packaging and shipping materials (excluding ice packs) at standard, and records manufacturing variances including purchase price and material usage variances as part of Labor & Overhead. If Qualigen's manufacturing variances exceed 3% of its total production costs in any True-Up Period referenced in Exhibit D, such variances are to be allocated between inventory and COGS based on total inventory turns for the applicable True-Up Period) Actual Labor & Overhead Costs - Consists of: Instrument and Reagent Manufacturing Cost Center Expenses - Including direct instrument and reagent manufacturing-related wages and related taxes and benefits, direct Property Plant & Equipment depreciation, direct production supplies, direct production-related repairs & maintenance expenses, inbound freight expenses, material variances and allocated manufacturing-related occupancy expenses for expenses such as rent, utilities, janitorial services, telephone expense, supplies and depreciation. Reagent manufacturing also includes an allocation of R&D department expenses relating to formulation oversight. In Qualigen's FY 2016 financial data, this allocation represented approximately $60k. Workers' comp insurance is included as part of the occupancy allocation in Qualigen's FY2016 financial results. Beginning with Qualigen's FY 2017 financial reporting, Workers' comp insurance will be included as a direct allocation to the Instrument and Reagent Manufacturing cost centers based on salary amounts. Quality Cost Center Expenses - Including wages and related taxes and benefits, equipment repairs and maintenance expenses, professional consulting services, supplies, dues & subscriptions, filing fees, depreciation and allocated Quality occupancy expenses.

Currently, the Medical Device Excise Tax provision of the Affordable Care Act is repealed (from Jan. 2016 through December 2017). However, should this provision be re-enacted, or similar such provision enacted, the cost of such excise taxes will be included as a cost element included in Actual Cost of Goods. The margin share and true-up process will reflect this cost.

KI, Inc. shall not be under any obligation whatsoever to       use KI's name, or any person, character, symbol, design, likeness, or       visual representation thereof in any radio or television program.\n\n                  (c) Diplomat agrees not to offer for sale, advertise, or       publicize any of the products licensed hereunder on radio or television       without the prior written approval of KI, Inc., which approval KI, Inc.       may grant or withhold in its unfettered discretion.\n\n            12.

In the       event any sale is made at a special price to any of Diplomat's       subsidiaries or to any other person, firm or corporation related in any       manner to Diplomat or its officers, directors or major stockholders, there       shall be a royalty paid on such sales based upon the price generally       charged the trade by Diplomat.\n\n                  (c) Diplomat agrees to sell to KI, Inc. such quantities of the       products at as low a rate and on as good terms as Diplomat sells similar       quantities of the products to the general trade.\n\n            13. Records.\n\n            Diplomat agrees to keep accurate books of account and records covering all transactions relating to the license hereby granted.

However, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the prepared statement indicates that KI, Inc., received less than all royalties payable to it under this Agreement, and the differential between the royalties received and those payable amounts to more than  % of the royalties received, then the cost of such statement shall be borne by Diplomat. In the event books of account and records shall be kept available for at least two (2) years after the termination of this license.\n\n            14. Bankruptcy, Violation, Etc.\n\n                  (a) If Diplomat shall not have commenced in good faith to       manufacture or distribute in commercial quantities sunglasses and       ophthalmic frames using KI's name within three months after the date of       this Agreement, or if at any time thereafter in any six calendar month       period Diplomat fails to sell or distribute sunglasses or ophthalmic       frames, or any other product described in subparagraph 2(a) of this       Agreement, KI Inc. may give notice of such failure with respect to any       such product which has not been so manufactured or distributed during the       six calendar month period. In the event that Diplomat does not commence       selling such product in commercial quantities within 90 days after such       notice, such notice shall be deemed to be a termination of this License       with respect to such product.\n\n                  (b) If Diplomat files a petition in bankruptcy, or is       adjudicated a bankrupt, or if a petition in bankruptcy is filed against       Diplomat, or if it becomes insolvent, or it makes an assignment for the       benefit of its creditors or an arrangement pursuant to any bankruptcy law,       or if Diplomat discontinues its business, or if a receiver is appointed       for it or its business, the license hereby granted shall automatically       terminate forthwith without any notice whatsoever being necessary. In the       event this license is so terminated, Diplomat, its receivers,       representatives, trustees, agents, administrators, successors and/or       assigns shall have no right to sell, exploit or in any way deal with or in       any of the products covered by this Agreement, or any carton, container,       packing or wrapping material, advertising, promotional or display material       pertaining thereto, except with and under the special consent and       instructions of KI, Inc. in writing, which they shall be obligated to       follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n                  (c) If Diplomat shall violate any of its other material       obligations under the terms of this Agreement, KI, Inc. shall have the       right to terminate the license hereby granted upon twenty (20) days'       notice in writing, and such notice of termination shall become effective       unless Diplomat shall\n\n                                       9\n\n      completely remedy the violation within the twenty-day period and satisfy       KI, Inc. that such violation has been remedied.\n\n                  (d) Termination of the license under the provisions of this       paragraph 14 shall be without prejudice to any rights which KI, Inc. may       otherwise have against Diplomat. Upon the termination of this license,       notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all royalties on sales       theretofore made shall become immediately due and payable and no minimum       royalties shall be repayable.\n\n            15. Final Statement Upon Termination or Expiration.\n\n            Sixty (60) days before the expiration of this license and, in the event of its termination, ten (10) days after receipt of notice of termination or the happening of the event which terminates this Agreement where no notice is required, a statement showing the number and description of products covered by this Agreement on hand or in process shall be furnished by Diplomat to KI, Inc. KI, Inc. shall have the right to take a physical inventory to ascertain or verify such inventory and statement and refusal by Diplomat to submit to such physical inventory by KI, Inc. shall forfeit Diplomat's right to dispose of such inventory, KI, Inc. retaining all other legal and equitable rights KI, Inc. may have under the circumstances.\n\n            16. Disposal of Stock Upon Termination or Expiration.\n\n            Upon and after the termination of the license, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Diplomat may dispose of products covered by this Agreement which are on hand, or in process at the time notice of termination is received, for a period of one hundred and twenty (120) days after notice of termination, provided advances and royalties with respect to that period are paid and statements are furnished for that period in accordance with paragraph 3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Diplomat shall not manufacture, sell or dispose of any products covered by this license after (a) the expiration of the license, or (b) the termination of the license based on (i) the failure of Diplomat to affix notice of copyright, trademark or service mark registration or any other notice to the products, cartons, containers, or packing or wrapping material or advertising, promotional or display material, or (ii) because of the departure by Diplomat from the quality and style approved by KI, Inc. pursuant to paragraph 9.\n\n            17. Effect of Termination or Expiration.\n\n            Upon and after the expiration or termination of this license, all rights granted to Diplomat hereunder shall forthwith revert to KI, Inc., who shall be free to license others to use KI's name in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of the products covered hereby, and Diplomat will refrain from further use of KI's name or any further reference to it, direct or indirect, or anything deemed by KI, Inc. to be similar to the KI's name, in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of Diplomat's products, except as provided in paragraph 17.\n\n                                       10\n\n            18. KI, Inc.'s Remedies.\n\n                  (a) Diplomat acknowledges that (except as otherwise provided       herein) its failure to commence in good faith to manufacture and       distribute in commercial quantities any one or more of the products listed       in subparagraph 2(a) within three (3) months of the date of this Agreement       and to continue during the term hereof to diligently and continuously       manufacture, distribute and sell the products covered by this Agreement,       or any class or category thereof, will result in immediate damages to KI,       Inc.\n\n                  (b) Diplomat also acknowledges that (except as otherwise       provided herein) its failure to cease the manufacture, sale or       distribution of the products covered by this Agreement, or any class or       category thereof, at the termination or expiration of this Agreement will       result in immediate and irremediable damage to KI, Inc. and to the rights       of any subsequent licensee. Diplomat acknowledges and admits that there is       no adequate remedy at law for such failure to cease manufacture, sale or       distribution, and Diplomat agrees that in the event of such failure KI,       Inc. shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of temporary and       permanent injunctions and such other further relief as any court with       jurisdiction may deem just and proper.\n\n                  (c) Resort to any remedies herein shall not be construed as a       waiver of any other rights and remedies to which KI, Inc. is entitled       under this Agreement or otherwise.\n\n            19. Excuse for Nonperformance.\n\n            Diplomat shall be released from its obligations hereunder and this license shall terminate in the event that governmental regulations or other\n\n\n\n\n\ncauses arising out of a state of national emergency, war, or causes beyond the control of the parties render performance impossible and one party so informs the other in writing of such causes and its desire to be so released. In such events, all royalties on sales theretofore made shall become immediately due and payable and no minimum royalties shall be repayable.\n\n            20. No Joint Venture.\n\n            Nothing herein contained shall be construed to place the parties in the relationship of partners or joint venturers, and Diplomat shall have no power to obligate or bind KI, Inc. in any manner whatsoever.\n\n            21. No Assignment or Sublicense by Diplomat.\n\n            This Agreement and all rights and duties hereunder are personal to Diplomat and shall not, without the written consent of KI, Inc., be assigned, mortgaged, sublicensed or otherwise encumbered by Diplomat or by operation of law.\n\n                                       11\n\n            KI, Inc. may assign its rights hereunder, but shall furnish written notice of such assignment to Diplomat.\n\n            22. No Waiver, Etc.\n\n            None of the terms of this Agreement can be waived or modified except by an express Agreement in writing signed by both parties. There are no representations, promises, warranties, covenants or undertakings other than those contained in this Agreement, which represents the entire understanding of the parties. The failure of either party hereto to enforce, or the delay by either party in enforcing, any of its rights under this Agreement shall not be deemed a continuing waiver or a modification thereof and either party may, within the time provided by applicable law, commence appropriate legal proceedings to enforce any or all of such rights. No person, firm, group or corporation (whether included in KI's name or otherwise) other than Diplomat and KI, Inc. shall be deemed to have acquired any rights by reason of anything contained in this Agreement, except as provided in paragraphs 8 and 22.\n\n            23. Additional Endorsers. If, during the term of this Agreement, Diplomat should utilize the services of any other person to endorse its products, and the public image of such person is so inconsistent with that of KI as to risk damaging the good will of KI's name should KI, Inc. continue to do business with Diplomat, then KI, Inc. shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, subject to the remedial and other provisions of paragraph 14 of this Agreement.\n\n            24. Miscellaneous Provisions.\n\n                  (a) Authority. KI, Inc. has the full right, power, legal       capacity and authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of KI, to       carry out its terms, and to grant Diplomat the rights, licenses and       privileges granted in this Agreement.\n\n                  (b) Merger. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior       written or oral agreements between the parties.\n\n                  (c) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and       construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without       regard to conflict of law principles.\n\n                  (d) Attorneys' Fees. The prevailing party in any proceeding       brought to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall be entitled to       recover the reasonable fees and costs of its counsel, plus all other costs       of such proceeding.\n\n                  (e) Notices. All notices and statements to be given, payments       to be made and materials to be submitted under this Agreement shall be       given, made and submitted via certified or registered mail, postage       prepaid, return\n\n                                       12\n\n      receipt requested, at the addresses of the parties, as set forth above,       unless notification of a change of address is given in writing, and the       date of mailing shall be deemed the date the notice or statement is given.\n\n            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been executed as of the date first set forth above.\n\n                                    /s/ Kathy Ireland                                                        ---------------------------------                                     KATHY IRELAND, Individually                                                                                                               KATHY IRELAND, INC.

Cincinnati, OH                          ABA No.:     042000398                          Account No.:     40-7690-5189                          Account Name:    Global Energy, Inc.

The Parties hereby form a strategic alliance having the following key elements:    (a) Preferred Suppliers. Oxbow and Global Energy hereby designate one another as their preferred suppliers of certain goods and services, as follows:    (i) Oxbow shall be the preferred petroleum coke supplier to petroleum coke gasification projects owned or controlled by Global Energy.    (ii) Oxbow shall be a preferred supplier of coal, coal fines, gob or waste coal products (collectively, \"Coal\") to gasification projects owned or controlled by Global Energy.    (iii) Global Energy shall be the preferred gasification technology supplier to petroleum coke gasification projects majority owned or controlled by Oxbow.    (iv) Global Energy shall be the preferred gasification project operator for petroleum coke gasification projects at sites majority owned or controlled by Oxbow.      2\n\n\n\n\n\n    (b) Further Cooperation. The Parties also agree to cooperate in good faith as follows in furtherance of their strategic alliance:    (i) Oxbow will identify Oxbow petroleum coke related sites for collaboration with Global Energy.    (ii) Global Energy will identify Global Energy petroleum coke related sites for collaboration with Oxbow.    The obligations of the Parties pursuant to this Section 2 are subject to continued demonstrated performance and their mutual agreement on the schedule, pricing, financing, economics and other terms and conditions applicable to any such project.    3. Lima Project. In addition to the strategic alliance described in Section 2 of this Agreement, the parties specifically agree to the following with respect to Global Energy's proposed Lima, Ohio gasification project (the \"Lima Project\"):    (a) Investment by Oxbow. Oxbow will make a investment (the \"Lima Investment\") in the company which owns the Lima Project (the \"Lima Project Company\") in the amount of [*], as consideration for obtaining the fuel supply management agreement for the Lima Project and the other revenues and benefits described in this Section 3. Oxbow's obligation to make this investment would be subject to:    (i) Oxbow obtaining the consent of its existing lenders; and    (ii) Global Energy securing one or more firm written commitments in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Oxbow for at least Two Hundred Seventeen Million and No/100 Dollars ($217,000,000.00) of equity funding for the Lima Project, or in the alternative, evidence demonstrating that Global has available cash of Two Hundred Seventeen Million and No/100 Dollars ($217,000,000.00) in its account.    (iii) Global Energy providing evidence satisfactory to Oxbow in its reasonable discretion that it has secured the right to purchase the site for the Lima Project from the City of Lima, Ohio for a purchase price of One Million Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($1,500,000.00).    (b) Revenues and Benefits to Oxbow. If Oxbow makes the Lima Investment:    (i) Oxbow will receive four percent (4%) of the Lima Project's pre-tax project cash flow after debt service and operation and maintenance (\"O&M\") expenses. The Lima Project Company's obligation to make such payment would be subject to satisfaction of the same lender covenants which will apply to distributions to equity investors in the Lima Project; and      3\n\n\n\n\n\n    (ii) Oxbow will receive two percent (2%) of those non-O&M revenues of Global Energy's affiliate, Gasification Engineering Corporation, Inc. (\"GEC\") related to the Lima Project (e.g., any of the $200 million EPC reserves/construction contingency which is not spent).    (iii) Oxbow will have a seat on the Board of Directors of GEC or any subsidiary or affiliate of GEC which is responsible for the engineering, procurement and construction (\"EPC\") contract for the Lima Project.    (c) Fuel Management and Supply Agreement. In addition, if Oxbow makes the Lima Investment, Oxbow and Global Energy will enter into a fuel management and supply agreement (the \"Fuel Management and Supply Agreement\") for all fuel to be utilized by the Lima Project, which would include the following material provisions:    (i) Oxbow will manage all fuel coke and Coal supply and logistics for the Lima Project.    (ii) Oxbow will be paid a management fee of One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) per year, such fee to be paid irrespective of actual Coal or petroleum coke use by the Lima Project.    (iii) As fuel supply manager, Oxbow will receive a base commission of $0.12 per MMBTU consumed by the Lima Project, independent of fuel type (the \"Base Commission\"). As an incentive to obtain the lowest cost of fuel throughout the life of the Lima Project, the Lima Project Company would receive two-thirds (2/3) of any cost savings below $1.07 per MMBTU delivered to the project (such price, the \"Price Basis\"), escalated each year beginning in 2009 in accordance with increases in the Consumer Price Index, and Oxbow would receive one- third (1/3) of any such cost savings. Should the price of fuel delivered to the Lima Project be above the Price Basis, the commission will be reduced on a sliding scale according to the following formula:    C= BC+(PB-PI)*0.1094    Where:    C = commission  BC = Base Commission  PI = price invoiced per MMBTU  PB = Price Basis per MMBTU    However, the commission will never be less than $0.05 per MMBTU regardless of fuel price. For purposes of calculating this commission, the price of all fuel supply transactions would be based on the direct cost of supply and transportation expenses as invoiced.      4\n\n\n\n\n\n    (iv) Global Energy may provide up to ten percent (10%) of the annual fuel requirements of the Lima Project from renewable sources. Oxbow would receive the same commission on a per-BTU basis on any such fuel supplied by Global Energy.    (d) Project Management. In the event Oxbow funds its investment in the Lima Project Company as set forth in Section 3(a), and either or both of the following occur:       (i)  Closing and funding of the Lima Project financing does not occur on or before December 15, 2007; or       (ii)  There is a delay of twelve months or more in meeting any project milestones as set forth in Schedule 3(d) (\"Project Milestones\");    then Oxbow shall have the right to take over the development and management of the Lima Project; provided, however, that the Lima Project fuel supply arrangements shall continue to be managed as set forth in the Fuel Management and Supply Agreement and Oxbow shall not be entitled to direct the disposition of ownership interests in the Lima Project Company, unless additional equity is required to finance the project. Further, if Oxbow elects to take over the development and management of the Lima Project and Oxbow subsequently determines that it does not desire to continue to participate in the Lima Project, it may withdraw from further participation, relinquish its economic interests in the Lima Project Company and GEC and terminate the Fuel Management and Supply Agreement, without further liability or obligation to Global Energy and/or the other Lima Project participants.    4.

These requirements may include those defined by the U.S. FDA's regulations At 21CFR314.80 (Post-marketing reporting of adverse drug experiences for drugs), 21CFR312.32 (IND safety reporting) 21CFR600.80 (Post marketing reporting of adverse experiences for biologics) 21CFR Parts 210 and 211 (\"current Good Manufacturing Practices\" or \"cGMPs\") with particular interest in 21CFR211.1.42 (Warehousing), 21CFR211.150 (Distribution), 21CFR211.204 (Returned drug) and 21CFR211.208 (Drug product salvaging), ICH Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance and/or others that may be appropriate for the particular project.   3. Scope   This Quality Agreement is to be applied to the activities performed by SCIEN, for HEMISPHERX as specifically defined by the Sales, Marketing, Distribution, and Supply Agreement January ___, 2016 (\"Agreement\") to which this Quality Agreement is an integral Exhibit. In the event of a conflict between the terms of the Agreement and this Quality Agreement, the terms of the Agreement shall control. Unless otherwise stated in these documents, SCIEN shall follow its Standard Operating Procedures (\"SOPs\") with respect to the activities it shall carry out in accordance with the Agreement. Copies of all relevant SOPs shall be provided to HEMISPHERX for review during audits.   4. Confidentiality   The information and procedures contained in this Quality Agreement are confidential and subject to the terms and conditions of the confidentiality provisions as set forth in the Confidential Disclosure Agreement September 22, 2014 (\"CDA\") executed by HEMISPHERX and SCIEN.   5. Terms   This Agreement between HEMISPHERX and SCIEN shall be in effect beginning the last date of execution set forth on the signature page to the Agreement (the \"Effective Date\") to which this Quality Agreement is Exhibit 2 and remain in effect until HEMISPHERX and SCIEN terminate the Agreement or it is superseded by a revised Quality Agreement executed by both parties.

Page 17 of 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  HEMISPHERX may perform audits for initial qualification of SCIEN as well as periodic audits and \"for cause\" audits. At mutually agreed upon times, HEMISPHERX may review standard operating and other quality control procedures and records and the records of SCIEN relating to the Agreement. Such routine and general oversight review is to be requested at least twenty (20) business days in advance, limited to two (2) persons, completed within one (1) to two (2) business days and shall be offered to HEMISPHERX one (1) time each calendar year. SCIEN will make every reasonable effort to accommodate the special circumstances that may arise pursuant to \"for cause\" audits. The following applies to all audits:   \u00b7 Prior to an audit HEMISPHERX will communicate to SCIEN the scope of the audit. \u00b7 HEMISPHERX will prepare a written report of the results of the audit and forward a copy to SCIEN.   SCIEN will provide a written response to HEMISPHERX's written audit report within twenty (20) business days of receipt of such report setting forth the corrective actions to be taken by SCIEN, if any, and a timeline for such implementation.   In the event of an inspection by any governmental or regulatory authority concerning the activities carried out under the Agreement, SCIEN shall notify HEMISPHERX promptly upon learning of such an inspection, shall supply HEMISPHERX with copies of any correspondence or portions of correspondence relating to HEMISPHERX's materials and shall inform HEMISPHERX of the general findings and outcomes of such inspections.   SCIEN and HEMISPHERX shall cooperate with each other during any such inspection, investigation or other inquiry, including applying reasonable effort, as might be practical, at allowing, upon reasonable request, a representative of HEMISPHERX to be on site during such inspection, investigation or other inquiry, and providing copies of all documents related to the inspection. Each party acknowledges that it may not direct the manner in which the other party fulfills its obligations to permit inspection by governmental entities   6. Dispute Resolution   If a dispute arises between the parties under this Agreement, the parties agree that, prior to either pursuing other available remedies, decision- making individuals from each party will promptly meet, either in person or by telephone, to attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the dispute. If, within sixty days after such meeting, the parties are unable to resolve the dispute (or such longer time as the parties may agree) either party is free to pursue its legal remedies.   7. Definitions   Adverse experience: Any adverse event associated with the use of a biological or drug product in humans, whether or not considered product related, including the following: an adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a biological or drug product in professional practice; an adverse event occurring from overdose of the product whether accidental or intentional; an adverse event occurring from abuse of the product; an adverse event occurring from withdrawal of the product; and any failure of expected pharmacological action.   Disability: A substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions.   Life-threatening adverse experience: Any adverse experience that places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred, i.e., it does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.   Labeled event: An adverse experience that is listed on the product insert as having been observed in patients who are receiving the drug product.\n\n{***} Confidential portions of this exhibit have been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a confidential treatment request in accordance with Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.   Page 18 of 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Drug Product: A finished dosage form, for example, tablet, capsule, or solution that contains an active ingredient generally, but not necessarily, in association with inactive ingredients   Serious adverse experience: Any adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse experience, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   Unexpected adverse experience: Any adverse experience that is not listed in the current labelling for the biological or drug product. This includes events that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labelling, but differ from the event because of greater severity or specificity.   For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the labeling only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the labeling only listed cerebral vascular accidents. \"Unexpected,\" as used in this definition, refers to an adverse experience that has not been previously observed (i.e., included in the labeling) rather than from the perspective of such experience not being anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical product.   Call report: A list of all questions, requests for circulars, and physician/patient complaints received by SCIEN's Clinical Support Department is prepared monthly by SCIEN staff and is forwarded to HEMISPHERX RA/QA Department.   Audit: A systematic examination of processes, controls and systems, operating procedures, reports, records and/or data to assess SCIEN's compliance with standards, regulatory submissions, SOPs; applicable laws, regulations, directives, standards and guidelines; the terms of this Agreement and other contracts in place defining the services being provided and to verify data integrity.   Good Clinical Practices (\"GCPs\"): Good clinical practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting trials that involve the participation of human subjects. Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and wellbeing of trial subjects are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical trial data are credible. ICH Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance.   Good Manufacturing Practices (\"GMPs\"): The recognized pharmaceutical regulations and requirements of regulatory authorities such as those defined by the U.S. FDA's regulations at 21CFR Parts 210 and 211.   Key Contacts: Persons at SCIEN and HEMISPHERX assigned to assure proper communication and follow-up in a timely manner within both parties' organizations. Names, titles and full contact information for Key Contacts shall be appended to this Agreement as Attachment 1 and should be maintained up-to-date during the course of the project.   Observation: A statement of fact made during an audit that is substantiated by objective evidence. HEMISPHERX categorizes observations as follows:   o Critical: May pose risk to patient or consumer or otherwise compromise the integrity or quality of the material, product, process, or service being provided. Other instances that could be defined as a critical observation include: A practice that poses an immediate safety risk to personnel; Quality System(s) missing or not in compliance with regulations, guidelines, or corporate policies.\n\n{***} Confidential portions of this exhibit have been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a confidential treatment request in accordance with Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.   Page 19 of 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  o Major: Does not fully comply with regulations, guidelines or corporate policies and may pose unnecessary risks to the integrity or quality of material, product, process or service being provided. Other instances that could be defined as a major observation include: Likely or probable safety risk to personnel; Quality System(s) weak or needing improvement; repeated Minor deficiencies of a similar nature that indicate a systemic problem and therefore may be classified as Major. o Minor: Does not comply with regulations, guidelines, or corporate policies but does not directly impact the integrity or quality of the material, product, process, or service being provided. o Comment: Compliant with regulations, guidelines and/or corporate policies; however, the auditor comment serves as a recommendation relative to maintaining or improving a specific condition noted.   Out-of-Specification / Out-of-Trend (\"OOS / \"OOT\"): A result that is not within the established specifications or trend, whether these are qualitative or quantitative.   Standard Operating Procedures (\"SOPs\"): Procedures in effect at SCIEN that define the processes and controls by and under which activities are to be conducted to assure compliance with the appropriate Code of Federal Regulations.   7. Communications   To assure proper communication, notification and follow-up in a timely manner by both parties, \"Key\" contacts are listed in Attachment 1 of this Agreement. Key contacts shall have access to project managers and technical staff and, upon reasonable notice and as required, facilitate resolution of any issues. Every effort will be made by SCIEN to accommodate timely communications, including face-to-face meetings, with HEMISPHERX.   8. Change of Control   SCIEN will maintain and follow change control SOP(s) to ensure that changes to equipment, procedures, processes, etc. occur in a controlled manner and in compliance with requirements e defined by the U.S. FDA's regulations (see Section 2).

SCIEN agrees to keep HEMISPHERX fully informed of any and all communications with regulatory agencies that may affect the services being provided to HEMISPHERX by SCIEN.   This Agreement is not meant to supersede or replace controlled documents typically used to define and record the work to be conducted by SCIEN for HEMISPHERX. Specific requirements of this Agreement and/or any service contracts shall be articulated within SCIEN's current operating procedures and documentation systems.   9.

In the event that mPhase's use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, in the          sole judgment of Lucent, may adversely affect Lucent's rights to the          mark shown on Schedule A or the marks and names LUCENT, LUCENT          TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN, Lucent may upon written          notification to mPhase, terminate this Agreement.\n\n4.       mPhase agrees that it acquires no rights to the Lucent Co-Branding Logo          nor to the marks LUCENT, LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING          DESIGN, by its use and that any use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo by          mPhase inures to the benefit of Lucent.\n\n5.       mPhase agrees not to adopt any designation which is confusingly similar          to the Lucent Co-Branding Logo or Lucent's marks LUCENT, LUCENT          TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN. Any attempt to do so          shall be a breach of this Agreement and Lucent may terminate this          Agreement without notice in the event of such a breach.\n\n6.       This Agreement shall terminate in the event of a significant change in          the management or ownership of mPhase or in the event mPhase is the          subject of any bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n7.       Lucent is generally aware of the current quality of mPhase's Goods.          mPhase agrees to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the          Lucent Co-Branding Logo to a level of quality comparable to the current          quality of their Goods.\n\n8.       If Lucent determines that mPhase's Goods are no longer maintained at          the current level of quality, Lucent shall so notify mPhase, in          writing, and Lucent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.\n\n9.       mPhase agrees to allow Lucent to inspect the Approved Uses bearing the          Lucent Co-Branding Logo, to ensure that those uses reviewed and          approved pursuant to the procedure set forth in Schedule B continue to          be in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.\n\n10.      In the event that mPhase becomes aware of any unauthorized use of the          Lucent Co-Branding Logo or other Lucent marks by third parties, mPhase          agrees to promptly notify Lucent and to cooperate fully, at Lucent's          expense, in any enforcement of Lucent's rights against such third\n\nSource: MPHASE TECHNOLOGIES INC, 10-K, 9/11/2003\n\n\n\n\n\nparties. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed to          require Lucent to enforce any rights against third parties or to          restrict Lucent's rights to license or consent to such third parties'          use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo or any other Lucent marks.\n\n11.      The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall          continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to          annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual          expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent          shall not be unreasonably withheld. Either party wishing to terminate          the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least          thirty (30) days prior to the desired date of termination.\n\n12.      Upon termination of this Agreement, mPhase shall immediately cease use          of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, provided, however, that mPhase shall          have no obligation to remove such Co-Branding Logo from any Goods sold          prior to the date of such termination.\n\n-2-\n\n13.      Neither Party shall be liable to the other for special, incidental, or          consequential damages, even if such Party has been advised of the          possibility of such damages.\n\n14.      This Agreement shall not be assigned by mPhase without the prior          written consent of Lucent.\n\n15.      The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be          governed by the laws of the State of New York.\n\n16.      This Agreement, including the Schedules and Addenda hereto, constitutes          the entire Agreement between the Parties concerning the subject matter          hereof and supersedes all proposals, oral or written, all negotiations,          conversations, and/or discussions between the Parties relating to this          Agreement and all past courses of dealing or industry customs.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties by their duly authorized representatives, have executed this Agreement on the respective dates indicated below.\n\nLucent Technologies Inc.                  mPhase, Inc.\n\nBy:  /s/ D.

Although mPhase may receive Co-branding approval for one    application, it has not been granted 'blanket use' of the Co-Branding Logo or    the Lucent Marks on all other applications.\n\no  Samples of each new or initial use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo should be    sent to Corporate Identity, Lucent Technologies, Attn: Bob Cort, Room 3A 405,    600 Mountain Avenue, Murray Hill, NJ 07974-0636; and to Lucent Technologies    Inc., Attn: Trademarks & Copyrights, Room 2F 181, 600 Mountain Avenue, Murray    Hill, NJ 07974-0636 for approval prior to any use of the materials.\n\n-5-\n\nSource: MPHASE TECHNOLOGIES INC, 10-K, 9/11/2003"

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Medica shall manufacture, in such quantities as Vapotherm orders, the Cartridge.\n\n1.2 [* * *]\n\n1.3 Purchase of Cartridge. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Vapotherm shall purchase from Medica Cartridges following regulatory approval.\n\nARTICLE 2 FORECASTS; INVENTORY\n\n2.1 Rolling Forecasts.\n\nAttached hereto and incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit A-2 is Vapotherm's initial forecast of Cartridges that Vapotherm will purchase for delivery on a monthly basis in calendar year 2013 (the \"Initial Forecast\"). On or prior to January 1, 2013 (the \"Forecast Initiation Date\"), Vapotherm shall deliver to Medica a forecast of Cartridge demand in each of the [* * *] consecutive months beginning one month following the FID. On or prior to one month following the FID, Vapotherm shall provide a forecast for the next [* * *] consecutive months beginning [* * *] months following the FID. On or prior to the first day of each subsequent month, Vapotherm shall deliver to Medica an update to its previously submitted forecast of its expected purchases of Cartridges (each forecast delivered pursuant to this Section 2.l(a), a \"Rolling Forecast\"). [* * *] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 406 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Vapotherm will place a firm Purchase Order for the following [* * *] months. Every month there after, Vapotherm will placed a PO for the following month to maintain a rolling [* * *] month commitment.\n\n(b) The forecast for any month specified in any Rolling Forecast may not be less than the total number of Cartridges for which Vapotherm, prior to delivery of that Rolling Forecast to Medica in accordance with Section 2.l(a), has submitted purchase orders in accordance with Section 3.2 specifying a delivery date in that month.\n\n2.2 Inventory.\n\nDuring the Term, Medica shall at all times maintain as safety stock that quantity of Cartridges equal to one (1) times the monthly average number of Cartridges ordered by Vapotherm during the immediately preceding [* * *] months.\n\nARTICLE 3 ORDERS, SHIPMENT, AND PAYMENT\n\n3.1 Price. The price paid by Vapotherm for any given shipment of Cartridges during the Initial Term is as stated in Exhibit A-1. No later than [* * *] days prior to the end of the Initial Term and each Renewal Term, Medica shall provide Vapotherm with reasonable documentation of its actual and direct costs in manufacturing the Cartridges (the \"Costs\"). The parties will then negotiate in good faith the Cartridge prices for the subsequent\n\n3.2 Purchase Orders.\n\n(a) Each purchase order that Vapotherm places for Cartridges must be in the form attached as Exhibit B and must specify (1) how many Cartridges are desired, (2) the one or more places to which, and the manner and date by which, delivery is to be made, and (3) the applicable price per Cartridge. Vapotherm shall deliver all purchase orders by facsimile, or by one of the means specified in Section 14.8 for giving notice, to Medica at the following address and facsimile number or as otherwise instructed by Medica:\n\nMedica S.p.A.

Vapotherm may order for delivery in any given Quarter an aggregate quantity of Cartridge not exceeding [* * *]% of the Final Forecast Quantity. Only with Medica's written consent may Vapotherm order for delivery in any given Quarter an aggregate number of Cartridges exceeding [* * *]% of the aggregate Final Forecast Quantity for the months in such Quarter. -2-\n\n[* * *] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 406 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Vapotherm shall deliver each purchase order for quantities of the Cartridge at least [* * *] in advance of the delivery date specified in that purchase order.\n\n(d) If Vapotherm delivers any purchase order with less lead time than is required under Section 3.2(c), then Medica shall use [* * *] efforts to fill that purchase order but will not be liable to Vapotherm if despite those best efforts they fail to do so.\n\n(e) Medica shall acknowledge and accept in writing on behalf of Medica any purchase order that Vapotherm places for Cartridges. Any such purchase order will be deemed accepted by Medica if Medica does not reject it by written notice to Vapotherm delivered within [* * *] Business Days of Medica's receiving that purchase order. Medica may not reject any purchase order that complies with the provisions of Article 3. If the terms of any purchase are inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will control.\n\n3.3 Delivery. Each shipment of Cartridges will be delivered by [* * *] to the applicable Vapotherm manufacturing facility or retained in Medica's warehouse facility, in accordance with Vapotherm instructions for each shipment. Medica shall deliver by the delivery date specified in a purchase order all of the Cartridges specified in that purchase order. Vapotherm is only required to pay for Cartridges actually delivered. Medica shall make shipping arrangements with carriers designated in writing by Vapotherm from the [* * *] point to points specified by Vapotherm, under the arrangements that Vapotherm has with those carriers.\n\n3.4 [* * *]\n\n3.5 Delay in Delivery. If for any reason other than an Event of Force Majeure, Medica delivers any shipment of Cartridges later than the date of delivery set out in the applicable purchase order, Vapotherm will be entitled to the following as an alternative, in its sole discretion, to its rights under Section 3.6 and Section 13.2(a):\n\n(1) a [* * *]% reduction in the price of each Cartridge in the shipment for every [* * *] the shipment is delayed (from the Required Ship Date specified in the Purchase Order) to a maximum of [* * *]%.\n\n3.6 Delivery Default Rights. If more than [* * *] days have passed since the delivery date for any Cartridges and Medica has, for any reason other than an Event of Force Majeure, failed to deliver those Cartridges, then, in addition to any other remedies it might have under this Agreement or by law, Vapotherm may cancel that purchase order or the portion thereof relating to those cartridges, as applicable.\n\n3.7 Invoices and Payment Terms. On delivery by Medica of a shipment of Cartridges in accordance with Section 3.3, Medica shall issue to Vapotherm an invoice for that shipment stating a price consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Vapotherm shall pay each such invoice in full within [* * *] Calendar Days from the date of invoice, unless Vapotherm has rejected the shipment in question in accordance with Section 4.2. -3-\n\n[* * *] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 406 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8 Delay in Payment. Upon delay of payment beyond [* * *] days from invoice date, Medica at its' sole discretion may levy an increase to the net transfer price a [* * *]% per week to a maximum of [* * *]%.\n\nARTICLE 4 QUALITY OF THE CARTRIDGE\n\n4.1 Conformity with Specifications. Any Cartridges that Medica manufactures under this Agreement must conform to the specifications in Exhibit D (the \"Specifications\") and (2) be manufactured, labeled, packaged, stored, and tested (while in the possession of, stored by, or under the control of Medica) in accordance with cGMP. Medica shall provide adequate packaging for protection during normal shipping and handling environments.\n\n4.2 Conditions to Rejection. In order to be entitled to reject any Cartridge, Vapotherm must notify Medica of any failure of the Cartridge to meet the Specifications or otherwise comply with this Agreement. Misuse or improper storage will not be grounds for rejection.\n\n4.3 Rejection. Vapotherm may reject any Cartridge that does not meet the Specifications or otherwise comply with this Agreement (any such Cartridge, a \"Nonconforming Cartridge\"). If Medica accepts that Vapotherm was entitled to reject the Nonconforming Cartridge(s) and Vapotherm has already paid the purchase price for the Nonconforming Cartridge(s), then, within [* * *] Calendar Days after receiving notice from Vapotherm under Section 4.2, Medica shall, at Vapotherm's election, either replace the Nonconforming Cartridge(s) at no additional cost to Vapotherm or reimburse Vapotherm for the purchase price of the Nonconforming Cartridge(s) via wire transfer. Further, if Medica accepts that Vapotherm was entitled to reject the Nonconforming Cartridge(s) and Vapotherm has not already paid the purchase price for the Nonconforming Cartridge(s), then, within [* * *] Calendar Days after receiving notice from Vapotherm under Section 4.2, Medical shall, at Vapotherm's election, either replace the Nonconforming Cartridge(s) at no additional to Vapotherm beyond the original purchase price charged to Vapotherm for the Nonconforming Cartridge(s) or cancel that purchase order or the portion thereof relating to the Nonconforming Cartridge(s), s applicable.\n\n(b) If Medica does not agree that one or more Cartridges constitute Nonconforming Cartridges, the Joint Review Committee, consisting of quality assurance representatives from both companies, must consider the matter. If after consideration by the Joint Review Committee the parties are unable to reach agreement within [* * *] Calendar Days after the date Medica received notice from Vapotherm under Section 4.2, they shall submit the dispute to arbitration in accordance with Section 14.5. -4-\n\n[* * *] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 406 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Nonconformity Default Rights. If for any reason other than an event of Force Majeure Medica (1) fails to replace any Nonconforming Cartridge as required by Section 4.3 or (2) fails to replace any Nonconforming Cartridge within [* * *] Business Days after a dispute regarding whether any rejected quantity of Cartridge constitutes Nonconforming Cartridge is decided in Vapotherm's favor, then, in addition to any other remedies it might have under this Agreement or by law, Vapotherm may cancel that purchase order or the portion thereof of relating to the Nonconforming Cartridge, as applicable.\n\n4.5 Acceptance of Cartridges. If Vapotherm does not notify Medica that one or more Cartridges do not meet the Specifications or otherwise fail to comply with this Agreement, those Cartridges will be deemed to have been accepted by Vapotherm as being fully compliant with the Specifications and this Agreement.\n\n4.6 Quality Monitoring. Medica will periodically sample and trend the Cartridge performance in accordance with specification and Medica's internal production tests to monitor process and product control. Medica will share the results with Vapotherm as part of the Production Process as outlined in Article 5.\n\n4.7 If Medica becomes aware of any Cartridge problem that could endanger patient health, Medica will report the problem to Vapotherm within 24 hours.\n\nARTICLE 5 PRODUCTION PROCESS\n\n5.1 Joint Review Committee.

First Offer for Development Opportunities. During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on December 31, 2018 (the \"Development Term\"), each Party (the \"Offering Party\") agrees to provide to the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\") a right of first offer with respect to any proposed offer or arrangement, which the Offering Party (or its affiliate) desires to accept, under which the Offering Party or one of its affiliates would acquire the ownership of real property in the Market Area (the \"Development Property\") on which a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort would operate (a \"Development Opportunity\").\n\nIf the Offering Party is required to offer the Receiving Party a Development Opportunity pursuant to this Section 1, the Offering Party must deliver written notice to the Receiving Party, together with reasonable due diligence information in the Offering Party's possession to enable the Receiving Party to evaluate the Development Opportunity (collectively, the \"Offer Notice\"). The Receiving Party will have ten (10) business days after receiving the Offer Notice to notify the Offering Party whether the Receiving Party exercises its right of first offer for that Development Opportunity. If the Receiving Party and exercises its right of first offer hereunder, and:\n\n(a) if the Receiving Party is Playa, then Playa (or its affiliate) and Hyatt's affiliate shall negotiate in good faith the terms of a management agreement and related documents under which Playa (or its affiliate) would manage a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort on the Development Property (subject to a franchise agreement between Hyatt and the affiliate of Hyatt that would own the Development Property), provided that Hyatt's affiliate acquires the Development Property on terms acceptable to it within sixty (60) days after delivery of the Offer Notice, and\n\n(b) if the Receiving Party is Hyatt, then Playa or its affiliate shall negotiate in good faith the terms of a franchise agreement and related documents for the operation (and, if applicable, development) of the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort on the Development Property, provided that Playa's affiliate acquires the Development Property on terms acceptable to it within sixty (60) days after delivery of the Offer Notice.   2\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Receiving Party declines its right of first offer with respect to any Development Opportunity, or fails to notify the Offering Party of its decision within the ten (10) business-day period described above, or if Hyatt's affiliate or Playa's affiliate (as applicable) fails to acquire the Development Property within the sixty (60)-day period described above, then the right of first offer with respect to that Development Opportunity shall expire, and the Offering Party thereafter may acquire, develop and/or operate (and/or grant any other person or entity the right to acquire, develop and/or operate) an all-inclusive resort or other business on the Development Property without any restriction under this Agreement, subject to any restrictions under any Existing Franchise Agreement or other agreement between Hyatt (or its affiliate) and Playa (or its affiliate).\n\n2. Introduction to Other Opportunities. If a third party (who is not an affiliate of Hyatt) approaches Hyatt during the Development Term with a proposed offer or arrangement, which Hyatt desires to accept, under which the third party would operate a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort in the Market Area, and if that third party has not then already designated a management company to operate that Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort, then Hyatt agrees to provide notice to Playa and introduce Playa to that third party for purposes of enabling Playa (at its option) to negotiate for the opportunity to manage that Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort for that third party. Similarly, if a third party (who is not an affiliate of Playa) approaches Playa during the Development Term with a proposed offer or arrangement, which Playa desires to accept, under which Playa or its affiliate would manage an all- inclusive resort in the Market Area for that third party, and if that third party has not then already designated a brand under which that all-inclusive resort would operate, then Playa agrees to provide notice to Hyatt and introduce Hyatt to that third party for purposes of enabling Hyatt (at its option) to negotiate for the opportunity to provide that third party franchise rights to brand that resort as a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort.\n\n3. Notices. Any notice required under this Agreement to be given by either Party to the other Party shall be in writing in the English language. Any required notice shall be effective two business days after it is sent by a recognized international courier service to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, or such other address as shall be notified to the other Party in writing, and any receipt issued by the courier service shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and date of sending of any such notice.\n\nContact details of the Parties are as follows:\n\nFor Hyatt: Hyatt Franchising Latin America Hyatt Hotels Corporation Hyatt Center - 12th Floor 71 South Wacker Drive Chicago, Illinois 60606 U.S.A.

To the extent there is any conflict between the Rules and the Federal Arbitration Act as it pertains to such arbitration, the Rules shall prevail.\n\n(b) The arbitration panel shall consist of:\n\n(i) one arbitrator in the event the aggregate damages sought by the claimant are stated to be less than Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$500,000), and the aggregate damages sought by the counter-claimant are stated to be less than Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$500,000); or   4\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) three arbitrators in the event the aggregate damages sought by the claimant are stated to be equal to or exceed Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$500,000), or the aggregate damages sought by the counterclaimant are stated to be equal to or exceed Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$500,000).\n\nEach arbitrator (1) shall have no fewer than ten (10) years' experience in the international hotel business, (2) shall be licensed to practice law in the United States, and (3) shall not be a person, or an affiliate of a person, who has any past, present or currently contemplated future business or personal relationship with either Playa, Hyatt or any of their respective affiliates.\n\n(c) The place of arbitration shall be New York, New York (USA).\n\n(d) The language to be used in the arbitration shall be English.\n\n(e) The arbitrator(s) shall have the power to grant any remedy or relief that they deem just and equitable, including injunctive relief, whether interim and/or final, and any provisional measures ordered by the arbitrator(s) may be specifically enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. Each Party hereto retains the right to seek interim measures from a judicial or other governmental authority, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate or a waiver of the right to arbitrate.\n\n(f) An arbitral tribunal constituted under this Agreement may, unless consolidation would prejudice the rights of any Party, consolidate an arbitration hereunder with an arbitration under any Franchise Agreement between Hyatt (or its affiliate) and Playa (or its affiliate), if the arbitration proceedings raise common questions of law or fact. If two or more arbitral tribunals under these agreements issue consolidation orders, the order issued first shall prevail.\n\n(g) The Parties agree that the award(s) shall be binding upon Hyatt and Playa and each Party's parent company or companies (and all other Affiliates), principals, successors, and assigns, and that judgment on the award(s) may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction, and the Parties waive any personal jurisdiction objections for the purpose of any enforcement proceedings under the 1958 United Nations Convention on the Recognition of Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. The arbitrator(s) may not award damages in excess of compensatory damages or otherwise in violation of the waiver in this Agreement.\n\n(h) Any award(s) shall be payable in U.S. Dollars. In the event that monetary damages are awarded, the award(s) shall include interest from the date of default to the date of payment of the award in full. The arbitrator(s) shall fix an appropriate rate of interest, compounded annually, which in no event shall be lower than the prime commercial lending rate charged by Hyatt's primary bank (as Hyatt may designate from time to time), to its most creditworthy commercial borrowers, averaged over the period from the date of the default to the date of the award.   5\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Any award(s) rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on the parties, and each party hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by law any right it may otherwise have under the laws of any jurisdiction to any form of appeal or collateral attack or to seek determination of a preliminary point of law by any courts (including any court within the Market Area or elsewhere).\n\n(j) The prevailing Party in any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the losing Party all reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing Party in connection with such arbitration (including any actions to enforce any award(s) or any of the provisions of this Section 5). If a Party prevails on some, but not all, of its claims, such Party shall be entitled to recover an equitable amount of such fees, costs and expenses as determined by the arbitrator(s). All amounts recovered by the prevailing Party under this Subsection shall be separate from, and in addition to, any other amount included in any award(s) rendered in favor of such Party pursuant to this Section 5.\n\n(k) Except as may be required by law, neither a Party nor its representatives nor a witness nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration or amicable settlement under this Section 5 (collectively, \"Dispute Information\") without the prior written consent of both Parties. Each Party shall ensure that the Dispute Information is not disclosed to the press or to any other third person or entity without the prior consent of the other Party. The Parties shall coordinate with one another on all public statements, whether written or oral and no matter how disseminated, regarding the Dispute Information.\n\n6. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior understandings and writings between the Parties. No Party may rely on any alleged oral or written understandings, agreements, or representations not contained in this Agreement. Any policies that either Party adopts and implements from time to time to guide them in their decision-making are subject to change, are not a part of this Agreement, and are not binding on them.\n\n7. Representations and Warranties. Each Party represents and warrants that neither the execution of this Agreement nor the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will (a) violate any provision of applicable law or any judgment, writ, injunction, order or decree of any court or governmental authority having jurisdiction over it; (b) cause a breach or default under any indenture, contract, other commitment or restriction to which it is a party or by which it is bound; or (c) require any filing, consent, vote or approval which has not been taken, or at the time when the transaction involved shall not have been given or taken. Each Party represents and warrants that as of the date hereof it has the full company power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its respective obligations under this Agreement, and that such Party's execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of such Party.\n\n8. Amendment. The provisions of this Agreement shall not be supplemented or amended except by an instrument in writing executed and delivered by both Parties.   6\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Waiver. Failure of either Party at any time to require the performance by the other Party of any provision hereof shall in no way affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter. Hyatt and Playa will not waive or impair any right, power, or option this Agreement reserves because of any custom or practice that varies from this Agreement's terms; Hyatt's or Playa's failure, refusal, or neglect to exercise any right under this Agreement or to insist upon the other's compliance with this Agreement; Hyatt's or Playa's waiver of or failure to exercise any right, power, or option, whether of the same, similar, or different nature, with other Hyatt All-Inclusive Resorts or any other agreements between the parties and/or their affiliates; or Hyatt's or Playa's acceptance of any payments due from the other Party after any breach of this Agreement (unless such payments are made within any applicable cure periods).\n\n10. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and bind the permitted assignees, successors and representatives of the Parties, except that no assignment, transfer, pledge, mortgage or lease by or through either Party in violation of the provisions of this Agreement shall vest any rights in the assignee, transferee, mortgagee, pledgee, or lessee, as the case may be.\n\n11. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be void, illegal, or unenforceable under the law, all other provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The Parties are, in this event, obligated to replace the void, illegal or unenforceable provision with a valid, legal and enforceable provision which corresponds as far as possible to the spirit and purpose of the void, illegal, or unenforceable provision.\n\n12. Language and Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which, taken together, shall constitute one and the same agreement and a Party may enter into this Agreement by executing a counterpart. This Agreement is executed in the English language, which shall prevail over any translation.\n\n13. No Representation Regarding Forecasts. In entering into this Agreement, Hyatt and Playa acknowledge that neither Playa nor Hyatt has made any representation to the other regarding forecasted earnings, the probability of future success or any other similar matter respecting the business contemplated under this Agreement and that Hyatt and Playa understand that no guarantee is made to the other as to any amount of income to be received by Hyatt or Playa or as to the future financial success of the business contemplated under this Agreement.\n\n14. Waiver of Non-compensatory Damages. In any action or proceeding between the Parties (including any arbitration proceeding) arising under or with respect to this Agreement or in any manner pertaining to the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resorts or to the relationship of the Parties under this Agreement, each Party hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives and releases any right, power or privilege either may have to claim or receive from the other Party any punitive or exemplary damages, each Party acknowledging and agreeing that the remedies herein provided and other remedies at law or in equity will in all circumstances be adequate. Both Parties acknowledge that they are experienced in negotiating agreements of this sort, and have had the advice of counsel in connection with, and fully understand the nature of, the waiver contained in this Section 14.   7\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Corrupt Practices. Neither Party, nor any person acting for or on behalf of such Party, shall make, and each Party acknowledges that the other Party will not make, any expenditure for any unlawful purposes (i.e. unlawful under the laws or regulations of the United States, the European Union or the Market Area) in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement or in connection with its activities in relation thereto. Neither Party, nor any person acting for or on behalf of such Party, shall, and each Party acknowledges that the other Party will not, bribe or offer to bribe any government official, any political party or official thereof, or any candidate for political office, for the purpose of influencing any action or decision of such person in their official capacity or any governmental authority of any jurisdiction.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed and delivered this Amendment on the day and year first above written.

Upon the breach of either of the above conditions, the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement as follows: (A) as to a default under  clause (i) above, if payment is not made within ten (10) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice of such failure to make  payment; or (B) as to a default under clause (ii) above, if such default is not cured within thirty (30) days after the defaulting party shall have  received written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default and such action the defaulting party must take in order to cure  each such item of default.     b) TERMINATION DUE TO INSOLVENCY. If either Party (the \"Bankrupt Party\"), (i) commences or becomes the subject of any case  or proceeding under the\n\nSource: BERKSHIRE HILLS BANCORP INC, 10-Q, 8/9/2012\n\n\n\n\n\n     bankruptcy or insolvency laws; (ii) has appointed for it or for any substantial part of its property a court-appointed receiver, liquidator, assignee,  trustee, custodian, sequestrator or other similar official; (iii) makes an assignment or the benefit of its credits; (iv) fails generally to pay its debts as  they become due; or (v) takes corporate action in furtherance of any of the foregoing (collectively, herein referred to as \"Events of Insolvency\"),  then, in each case, the Bankrupt Party shall immediately give notice of such event to the other Party. Whether or not such notice is given, the  other Party shall have the right, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, following the occurrence of any Event of Insolvency and  without prejudice to any other rights it may have, at any time thereafter to terminate this Agreement, effective immediately upon giving notice to  the Bankrupt Party.     c) EFFECT OF TERMINATION. Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason (i) all payments that have accrued  prior to the termination or expiration of this Agreement will be payable in full within thirty (30) days thereof, but any obligations to make further  payments due, or that may have come due, under this Agreement shall become null and void; (ii) except as otherwise provided herein, the Services  Period and the Contract Period shall end immediately and Berkshire shall promptly cease all use of the Auriemma Identification including any  displays, documents, artwork, symbols, logos trademarks, trade names, photographic or graphic representations, depictions and/or other materials  (including, but not limited to, advertising and/or promotional materials), which in any way or form (hard copy, electronic or otherwise) use the  Auriemma Identification (collectively, \"Materials\"), except as otherwise set forth herein; and (iii) except as otherwise provided herein, Berkshire  shall promptly remove all links and references to Auriemma and Materials from its website. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Agreement is  terminated for any reason other than Berkshire's material breach, then for thirty (30) days following such termination, Berkshire may continue to  use any printed material already produced under this Agreement. At the conclusion of this period, Berkshire's use of the printed material will  cease.     11. TERMINATION BY BERKSHIRE.     Berkshire may terminate this Agreement immediately by giving Auriemma notice if (i) Auriemma dies or is prevented by injury or illness from  satisfactorily performing the obligations required by this Agreement; (ii) Auriemma is convicted of a felony or criminal offense involving  dishonesty or fraud; or (iii) Auriemma publicly disparages Berkshire and/ or its products.     12. OTHER REMEDIES AND RIGHTS.     The termination rights set forth herein shall not constitute the exclusive remedy of the non-defaulting party. Termination in accordance with the  above provisions shall be without prejudice to any rights or claims, which the terminating party may otherwise have against the defaulting party.  In the event of any arbitration or litigation, including breach, enforcement or interpretation, arising out of this Agreement, the prevailing party\n\nSource: BERKSHIRE HILLS BANCORP INC, 10-Q, 8/9/2012\n\n\n\n\n\n     of such litigation shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees, costs, and expenses, including pre-litigation and appellate attorneys' fees  and costs.     13.

ASSIGNMENT.     This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of Auriemma and his successors and permitted assigns.

WHEREAS, Buyer, Gulf Houghton and other shareholders of the Company are parties to a Share Purchase Agreement dated as of April 4, 2017, under which Buyer is acquiring the Shares (the \"Purchase Agreement\"). Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Purchase Agreement. WHEREAS, Sellers, together with the Company, have been substantially involved in and with the Company's operations and management and possess trade secrets and other confidential information relating to the Company Business and the Company's clients, customers, vendors, suppliers and operations. WHEREAS, it is integral to Buyer's acquisition of the Company Business and a condition precedent to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement that the Sellers enter into this Agreement with Buyer to provide for the protection of the Combined Business's customer and vendor relationships, trade secrets, confidential information and other business operations. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Gulf Houghton shall receive cash consideration and shares of Buyer's capital stock in exchange for the Shares owned by Gulf Houghton and as inducement for Gulf Houghton and the other Sellers to enter into this Agreement. NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and in the Purchase Agreement, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 1. Confidentiality; Non-competition; Non-solicitation. (a) From and after the date hereof, each Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, hold, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its or their respective Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information, whether written or oral, concerning Buyer, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, except to the extent that such Seller can show that such information: (i) is generally available to and known by the public through no fault of any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or (ii) is lawfully acquired by such Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and after the date hereof from sources that are not prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If any Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives are compelled to disclose any information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, such Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only that portion of such information that such Seller is advised by its counsel is legally required to be disclosed, provided that such Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information.\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the \"Non- Compete Period\"), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer's capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any business which competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged in any Combined Business; provided, however that nothing in this Agreement shall: (i) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from owning, as a passive investor, not more than five (5%) percent collectively and in the aggregate of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person so engaged; (ii) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from engaging in such Seller's business as conducted on the Effective Date and reasonable extensions thereof, which may include routine, day-to-day transactions with any entity, and (iii) apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller acquires control after the Effective Date provided that the acquired business did not receive more than $25,000,000 of its aggregate net sales (as measured during the 12 full calendar months prior to such acquisition) from product lines included within the definition of Company Business. Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. (c) Gulf Oil and Gulf India each agree during the Non-Compete Period not to acquire, directly or indirectly, control of any businesses involved in, or otherwise competing with, the business of the Combined Business from any entity on Schedule 1 hereto. (d) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the \"Non-Solicit Period\"), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business. Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nemployees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period. (e) It is the intention of the parties that the covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be enforced to the greatest extent (but to no greater extent) in time, area and degree of participation as is permitted by the Law of that jurisdiction whose Law is applicable to any acts allegedly in breach of such covenants. To this end, the parties agree that the covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be construed to extend in time and territory and with respect to degree of participation only so far as they may be enforced in such jurisdiction, and that the covenants contained in this Section 1 are to that end hereby declared divisible and severable. It being the purpose of this Section 1 to govern competition by the Sellers and their respective subsidiaries, the non-competition covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be governed by and construed according to the Law of all the jurisdictions in which competition in breach of this Agreement is alleged to have occurred or to be threatened that best gives them effect. 2.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 4(C) [Governing Law]. 5. Injunctive Relief; Attorneys Fees. Each Seller agrees that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, the damage to Buyer will be inestimable and that therefore any remedy at Law or in monetary damages shall be inadequate. Accordingly, the parties agree that Buyer shall, in addition to monetary damages incurred by reason of any such breach or potential breach, without the necessity of posting any bond or similar instrument (and Sellers hereby irrevocably waive any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument) be entitled to seek injunctive relief (including specific performance) against the Sellers for breach of this Agreement. If any action or proceeding shall be commenced to enforce this Agreement or any right arising in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the other party the reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expenses incurred by such prevailing party in connection with such action or proceeding. 6. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the parties hereto are parties constitute the sole and entire agreement of the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings and agreements, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. 7. Amendment Waivers, etc. No amendment, modification or discharge of this Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the party against whom enforcement of the amendment, modification, discharge or waiver is sought. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nspecific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by a party of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any party, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights or remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity. 8. Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 9. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and both of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party, this Agreement shall have no effect and none of the parties shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). Facsimiles, e-mail transmission of .pdf signatures or other electronic copies of signatures shall be deemed to be original counterparts. No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 10. Cooperation; Further Assurances. Each of the parties shall execute such further instruments and take such other actions as the other party shall reasonably request in order to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement. 11.

The captions herein are included for convenience of reference only and shall be ignored in the construction or interpretation hereof.

HOFV and/or PFHOF, on the one hand, and Constellation, on the other hand, are referred to herein as a \"Party\" and, collectively, as the \"Parties\". WITNESSETH: WHEREAS, Constellation desires to provide to the HOF Entities, and the HOF Entities desire to obtain from Constellation, certain of Constellation's products and services listed and described in Exhibit A (collectively, the \"Products & Services\") for use in connection with the Johnson Controls Hall of Fame Village in Canton, Ohio (the \"Village\"); and WHEREAS, Constellation desires to become a sponsor of the Village and to obtain the rights set forth herein in connection with such sponsorship. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises herein contained, the Parties hereto agree as follows: ARTICLE 1\n\nSUPPLY OF PRODUCTS & SERVICES 1.1 Sale of Products & Services. (a) The HOF Entities shall consult with Constellation to develop a comprehensive energy strategy with respect to the Products & Services listing in Exhibit A, which reflects sustainable product solutions, competitive market pricing (incorporating completion of the Supplier Component Questionnaire in the form of Exhibit B hereof for the applicable HOF Entity or affiliate), periodic reporting and analytics, regulatory/market intelligence and infrastructure services and equipment.\n\nSource: GPAQ ACQUISITION HOLDINGS, INC., S-4/A, 1/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The HOF Entities or their affiliates shall, during the Term (as defined below), purchase from Constellation, and Constellation shall sell to the HOF Entities and/or their affiliates, as applicable, such Products & Services as shall be requested by an HOF Entity or its affiliates, in each case at the applicable Market Prices for such Products & Services and on competitive terms.

In the event that the purchaser of Products & Services pursuant to this Article 1 is an affiliate of an HOF Entity (but not an HOF Entity), such affiliate shall be subject to Constellation's credit approval of such affiliate as the contracting entity. In the event that such affiliate does not meet Constellation's credit requirements (and in the event that such affiliate still desires to purchase such Products & Services), such affiliate shall provide to Constellation a surety bond reasonably acceptable to Constellation from a provider rated than A- (or an equivalent rating from S&P, Moody's, Fitch or AM Best) or better prior to the purchase of such Products & Services.

No amendment or modification of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be effective unless such modification is expressed in writing and executed by each of the Parties. 6.5 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio, without reference to principles of conflicts of law. Any suit or action filed or otherwise commenced in connection with this Agreement must be filed and litigated in an appropriate court located in the City of Canton, Ohio (provided, however, that if the suit or action involves a claim for which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, then such suit or action must be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of the State of Ohio in Akron, Ohio), or such other venue as deemed appropriate by the HOF Entities. In the event of a dispute between an HOF Entity and Constellation regarding their rights and duties hereunder, the non-prevailing Party in any ensuing litigation shall pay the reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of the prevailing Party (including costs of discovery and expert witness fees). 6.6 Subordination. This Agreement shall in all respects be subordinate to any and all agreements executed prior to the date of this Agreement between the HOF Entities and Johnson Controls, Inc. or any of its affiliates. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any such agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed superseded by such conflicting provision of such other agreement. 6.7 Force Majeure. (a) Fire or Other Damage to Village. If the Village is damaged by fire, earthquake, act of God, the elements or other casualty or is condemned by an authority exercising the powers of eminent domain or the Village is transferred in lieu of the exercise of such power so as to render the Village unusable for its intended purpose at any time during the Term, then the HOF Entities shall have the option, but not the obligation, to repair the damage or loss. The HOF Entities shall notify Constellation as to whether the HOF Entities shall effect such repair and restoration within thirty (30) days after the casualty. If the HOF Entities notify Constellation that the HOF Entities are electing to effect such repairs and restoration, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect; provided, however, that the Term shall be extended by such number of days as equals the length of the period from the date of the event until such repairs and restoration are complete. If the HOF Entities notify Constellation that the HOF Entities are electing not to effect such repairs and restoration, then this Agreement and all rights granted hereunder shall terminate as of the date of such fire or other casualty. (b) Other. Except as otherwise set forth herein, neither Party shall be liable or responsible for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder, which failure is caused or brought about in any manner beyond the control of such Party, including, but not limited to, the breakdown or failure of apparatus, equipment, or machinery employed in its supply of said services, any temporary stoppage for the repair, improvement or enlargement thereof, or any other act or condition beyond its reasonable control, other than such Party's inability to perform payment obligations.\n\n14\n\nSource: GPAQ ACQUISITION HOLDINGS, INC., S-4/A, 1/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Tolling. In the event that, after the construction and development of the Village has been substantially completed, the Village is not usable for a period of at least thirty (30) days as a result of the events described under this Section 6.7 and unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Term shall be extended for that period of time (after substantial completion) which the Village was not usable and the start and end dates of each period shall be adjusted to reflect the number of days (after substantial completion) in which the Village was not usable for all purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation the expiration date of the Term. 6.8 Not a Lease or License of the Village. This Agreement will not constitute a lease or license of any part of the Village. It will represent solely a contractual obligation of the HOF Entities to provide to Constellation certain other benefits hereunder. 6.9 Insurance. Constellation shall, at its own expense, secure and maintain in full force and effect throughout the Term (a) insurance coverage for defamation, trademark and service mark infringement, unfair competition, copyright infringement, and infringement of a person's right of publicity and right of privacy from a carrier with an A.M. Best rating of A10 or better in an amount not less than [***] per occurrence; and (b) a general liability insurance policy from a carrier with an A.M. Best rating of A10 or better in an amount not less than [***] in aggregate. The liability limits may be met with any combination of primary and excess or umbrella insurance policy limits. Constellation shall provide the HOF Entities with certificates of insurance, naming each HOF Entity as an additional insured, evidencing the existence of such insurance policies within ten (10) days after execution of this Agreement. 6.10 Confidentiality. Without limiting the generality of the obligations set forth in the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement between Constellation and HOFV dated as of April 28, 2018 (which shall survive in accordance with its terms), the Parties hereto agree to maintain in confidence the terms and conditions of this Agreement (except with respect to their owners, lenders and advisors, each of whom is to be made aware of and instructed to comply with this confidentiality provision) unless the proposed disclosure of specific terms or conditions hereof is authorized in advance by the other Party or is otherwise required by law. In the event that either Party or any of its representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, such Party shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide the other Party with prompt written notice before such disclosure, sufficient to enable such other Party either to seek a protective order, at its expense, or another appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such disclosure or to waive compliance with the provisions of this Section, or both. 6.11 Press Releases. The HOF Entities and Constellation shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or scheduling any press conference or conference call with media members or other third parties with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The HOF Entities and Constellation shall mutually agree on the content of any such press release prior to its publication. 6.12 No Defamation or Disparagement. No Party will make, issue or release any statement which results in any defamation or disparagement of the Village, the City of Canton, the other Party, or any team, person, performer or organization involved in events at the Village.\n\n15\n\nSource: GPAQ ACQUISITION HOLDINGS, INC., S-4/A, 1/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n6.13 Independent Contractor. The Parties shall be and act as independent contractors, and under no circumstances shall this Agreement be construed as one of agency, partnership, joint venture or employment among the Parties. 6.14 Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are solely for convenience and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of the provisions set forth herein. 6.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, and on separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 6.16 Waiver. No action, other than a notice by a Party to another Party specifically stating that such notice has the effect of waiver, shall constitute a waiver of any particular breach or default of such other Party. No such waiver notice from a Party shall waive any other Party's failure to fully comply with any other term, condition, or provision of this Agreement, irrespective of any knowledge any HOF Entity or Constellation officer, manager, employee, or agent may have of any breach or default of, or noncompliance with, such other term, condition, or provision. No waiver of full performance by a Party shall be construed, or operate, as a waiver of any subsequent default of any of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Agreement. The payment or acceptance of fees or charges for any period after a default shall not be deemed a waiver of any right or acceptance of defective performance. 6.17 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be contrary to law and unenforceable by any court of law, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 6.18 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the HOF Entity Indemnified Persons and Constellation Indemnified Persons, (i) this Agreement is intended only for the benefit of the Parties hereto, the affiliates of the HOF Entities and any successors, permitted assigns or substitutes as expressly provided for in this Agreement, (ii) no other person or entity is intended to be benefited in any way by this Agreement and (iii) this Agreement shall not be enforceable by any other person or entity. 6.19 Cost and Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 6.20 HOF Entity Rights and Obligations. The Parties acknowledge and agree that rights vested in the HOF Entities collectively under this Agreement shall be deemed vested in each HOF Entity and its affiliates and that obligations of the HOF Entities collectively under this Agreement may be satisfied by either HOF Entity or any of their affiliates. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, while certain rights set forth in this Agreement may be contemplated to be provided by HOFV and other rights set forth in this Agreement may be contemplated to be provided by PFHOF (or by both HOF Entities), each of such rights may be provided by HOFV, PFHOF and/or any of their respective affiliates.

Any limitations on the quantities to be received from each Point of Receipt and/or delivered to each Point of Delivery shall be as specified on Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto.   1.2 EQUIVALENT QUANTITY - shall be as defined in Article I of the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff.   ARTICLE II - TRANSPORTATION   Transportation Service - Transporter agrees to accept and receive daily on a firm basis, at the Point(s) of Receipt from Shipper or for Shipper's account such quantity of gas as Shipper makes available up to the Transportation Quantity, and to deliver to or for the account of Shipper to the Point(s) of Delivery an Equivalent Quantity of gas.   ARTICLE III - POINT(S) OF RECEIPT AND DELIVERY   The Primary Point(s) of Receipt and Delivery shall be those points specified on Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto.   ARTICLE IV   4.1 All facilities are in place to render the service provided for in this Agreement.   4.2 Pursuant to Article VIII, Section 1 of the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's Tariff (\"GT&C\"), Transporter shall cause the delivery of natural gas to Shipper at the Shipper's Primary Point of Delivery as nearly as practicable to Transporter's line pressure, provided that such line pressure shall not be less than 500 pounds per square inch gauge at Monroe, meter number 020843, and 600 pounds per square inch gauge at Calvary, meter number 020844. Transporter shall be obligated to provide such minimum pressures only to the extent that capacity is reserved by Shipper and scheduled by Transporter at the Primary Delivery Point(s) described above. Such minimum pressure obligation is subject to the GT&C including, but not limited to, Article X - Excuse of Performances.   In the event Transporter is unable to maintain the minimum pressure(s) described herein but Shipper is still able to take receipt of the scheduled quantity at the Primary Delivery Point(s) described above, then Shipper shall be considered unharmed by Transporter's inability to maintain such minimum pressure(s). Subject to the foregoing, any failure on Transporter's part to deliver the scheduled quantity at the Primary Delivery Point(s)   1\n\n\n\n\n\n  described above shall entitle Shipper to the limited remedy specified in Rate Schedule FT-A, Section 7 - Failure of Transporter.   ARTICLE V - QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS FOR MEASUREMENT   For all gas received, transported and delivered hereunder the Parties agree to the Quality Specifications and Standards for Measurement as specified in the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff Volume No. 1.

Transporter agrees that Shipper may protest or contest the aforementioned filings, or may seek authorization from duly constituted regulatory authorities for such adjustment of Transporter's existing FERC Gas Tariff as may be found necessary to assure Transporter just and reasonable rates.   2\n\n\n\n\n\n  ARTICLE VII - BILLINGS AND PAYMENTS   Transporter shall bill and shipper shall pay all rates and charges in accordance with Articles V and VI, respectively, of the General Terms and Conditions of the FERC Gas Tariff.   ARTICLE VIII - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS   This Agreement shall be subject to the effective provisions of Transporter's Rate Schedule FT-A and to the General Terms and Conditions incorporated therein, as the same may be changed or superseded from time to time in accordance with the rules and regulations of the FERC.   ARTICLE IX - REGULATION   9.1 This Agreement shall be subject to all applicable and lawful governmental statutes, orders, rules and regulations and is contingent upon the receipt and continuation of all necessary regulatory approvals or authorizations upon terms acceptable to Transporter.

Suite 700 Washington, D.C. 20006\n\nLadies and Gentlemen:\n\n                  AFSALA  Bancorp,  Inc. (the  \"Company\") and Amsterdam  Federal Savings and Loan  Association,  a federally  chartered  mutual  savings and loan association  (\"Association\"),  with its deposit  accounts insured by the Savings Association   Insurance  Fund  (\"SAIF\")  administered  by  the  Federal  Deposit Insurance  Corporation  (\"FDIC\"),  hereby  confirm their  agreement with Capital Resources, Inc. (\"Capital Resources\") as follows:\n\n                  SECTION 1. The Offering.  The Association,  in accordance with and pursuant to its plan of conversion  adopted by the Board of Directors of the Association  (the \"Plan\"),  intends to be converted  from a  federally-chartered mutual savings and loan association to a federally-chartered  stock savings bank and will  sell all of its  issued  and  outstanding  stock to the  Company.  The Company  will  offer  and  sell its  common  stock  (the  \"Common  Stock\")  in a subscription  offering  (\"Subscription  Offering\") to (1) tax qualified employee benefit plans of the Association,  (2) depositors of the Association as of March 31, 1995 (\"Eligible Account  Holders\"),  (3) depositors of the Association as of June 30, 1996  (\"Supplemental  Eligible  Account  Holders\"),  (4) certain  other deposit  account  holders  and  borrower  members  of  the  Association  (\"Other Members\") and (5) to its employees,  officers and directors,  pursuant to rights to  subscribe  for shares of Common Stock (the  \"Shares\").  Subject to the prior subscription rights of the above-listed  parties, the Company may offer for sale in a public offering (the \"Public  Offering,\" and when referred to together with the Subscription  Offering,  the \"Subscription and Public Offerings\")  conducted after the Subscription  Offering, the Shares not so subscribed for or ordered in the  Subscription  Offering  to the  general  public  (all such  offerees  being referred to in the aggregate as \"Eligible Offerees\"). Shares may also be sold in the Public Offering by a selling group of  broker-dealers  organized and managed by Capital  Resources.  It is  acknowledged  that the  purchase of Shares in the Subscription  and Public  Offerings  is subject to maximum and minimum  purchase limitations as described in the Plan and that the Company may reject in whole or in part any subscriptions received from subscribers in the Public Offering.\n\n                  The  Company  and the  Association  desire to  retain  Capital Resources to assist the Company with its sale of the Shares in the  Subscription and Public  Offerings.  By and  through  this  Agreement,  the  Company  and the Association confirm the retention of Capital Resources to assist the Company and the Association during the Subscription and Public Offerings.\n\n                  The  Company  has  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange Commission  (the  \"Commission\")  a registration  statement on Form S-l (File No. 333-6399)  containing an offering  prospectus  relating to the  Subscription and Public  Offerings for the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"1933 Act\"),  and has filed such  amendments  thereto,  if any, and such amended  prospectuses as may have been required to the date hereof (the  \"Registration  Statement\").  The prospectus,  as amended,  included in the Registration   Statement  at  the  time  it  initially  becomes  effective,   is hereinafter called the \"Offering  Prospectus\",  except that if any prospectus is filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the \"1933 Act Regulations\") differing from the offering  prospectus  included in the Registration  Statement at the time it initially becomes effective,  the term \"Offering  Prospectus\" shall refer to the offering prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from and after the time said offering prospectus is filed with or mailed to the Commission for filing.\n\n                  In accordance  with Title 12, Part 563b of the Code of Federal Regulations (the \"Conversion  Regulations\"),  the Association has filed with the Office  of Thrift  Supervision  (the  \"OTS\")  an  Application  for  Approval  of Conversion  on Form AC (the  \"Conversion  Application\")  including  the Offering\n\n\n\n\n\nProspectus  and has filed  such  amendments  thereto,  if any,  as may have been required by the OTS. The  Conversion  Application  has been approved by the OTS. The Company has filed with the OTS its application on Form H-(e)lS (the \"Holding Company  Application\")  to acquire the  Association  under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. ss. 1467a) (\"HOLA\").\n\n                  SECTION 2. Retention of Capital Resources;  Compensation; Sale and  Delivery  of the  Shares.  Subject to the terms and  conditions  herein set forth, the Company and the Association hereby appoint Capital Resources as their agent to advise and assist the Company and the  Association  with the  Company's sale of the Shares in the Subscription and Public Offerings.\n\n                  On  the  basis  of  the   representations,   warranties,   and agreements herein contained,  but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, Capital Resources accepts such appointment and agrees to consult with and advise the Company and the Association as to matters  relating to the Conversion and the Subscription and Public Offerings. It is acknowledged by the Company and the  Association  that Capital  Resources  shall not be required to purchase any Shares and shall not be obligated to take any action which is inconsistent  with any  applicable  laws,  regulations,  decisions  or orders.  If requested by the Company or the  Association,  Capital  Resources  also may assemble and manage a selling group of broker dealers which are members of the National Association of Securities  Dealers,  Inc. (the \"NASD\") to  participate in the  solicitation  of purchase  orders  for  Shares  under a selected  dealers'  agreement  (\"Selected Dealers'  Agreement\").

The  activities of the  Association as described  in the  Offering  Prospectus,  insofar  as they are  material  to the operations  and  financial  condition of the  Association,  are permitted by the rules,  regulations and resolutions and practices of the OTS or the FDIC and any other federal or state authorities.\n\n                  (iv)  The  Association  is a  member  of the  FHLBNY,  and the deposit  accounts of the  Association  are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum amount  allowed  under  law  and to the  best  of such  counsel's  knowledge  no proceedings  for the  termination or revocation of such insurance are pending or threatened;  and the description of the liquidation  account as set forth in the Registration  Statement  and the  Offering  Prospectus  under the  caption  \"The Conversion - Effects of Conversion to Stock Form on Depositors  and Borrowers of the  Bank -  Liquidation  Account\"  has been  reviewed  by such  counsel  and is accurate in all material respects.\n\n                  (v)  Upon  consummation  of the  Conversion,  the  authorized, issued and outstanding  capital stock of the Company will be as set forth in the Registration   Statement   and  the  Offering   Prospectus   under  the  caption \"Capitalization,\"  and no shares of Common  Stock have been issued  prior to the Closing Date; at the time of the Conversion,  the Shares subscribed for pursuant to the Offerings will have been duly and validly  authorized  for issuance,  and when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to the Plan against payment of\n\n\n\n\n\nthe consideration  calculated as set forth in the Plan, will be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable;  and the issuance of the Shares is not subject to preemptive rights.\n\n                  (vi)  The  issuance  and  sale  of  the  common  stock  of the Association  to the  Company  have  been  duly  and  validly  authorized  by all necessary  corporate  action on the part of the Company and the Association and, upon payment  therefor in accordance  with the terms of the Plan of  Conversion, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will be owned of  record  by the  Company,  free and  clear  of any  mortgage,  pledge,  lien, encumbrance or claim (legal or equitable).\n\n                  (vii) The  execution  and delivery of this  Agreement  and the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized  by  all  necessary  action  on  the  part  of the  Company  and  the Association; and this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of the Company and the  Association,  enforceable  in accordance  with its terms (except as the enforceability  thereof may be limited by  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  moratorium, reorganization  or similar laws  relating to or  affecting  the  enforcement  of creditors'  rights generally or the rights of creditors of savings  associations or savings and loan holding  companies,  the accounts of whose  subsidiaries are insured by the FDIC or by general equity principles,  regardless of whether such enforceability  is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and except to the  extent,  if any,  that the  provisions  of  Sections 9 and 10 hereof may be unenforceable as against public policy).\n\n                  (viii) The Plan has been duly adopted by the required  vote of the Directors of the Company and the Association and members of the Association.\n\n                                      -16-\n\n                  (ix)  Subject to the  satisfaction  of the  conditions  to the OTS's approval of the  Conversion  and the Company's  application to acquire the Association, no further approval, registration,  authorization, consent or other order of any regulatory  agency,  public board or body is required in connection with the  execution and delivery of this  Agreement,  the issuance of the Shares and the  consummation  of the  Conversion,  except as may be required  under the regulations of the NASD and the NASDAQ National Market.

The OTS has issued its order of  approval  under the savings and loan holding company provisions of the HOLA, and the purchase by the Company of all of the issued and  outstanding  capital stock of the  Association has been  authorized  by the OTS and no action has been taken,  or to  counsel's knowledge  is  pending  or  threatened,  to  revoke  any such  authorization  or approval.\n\n                  (xi) The  Registration  Statement is effective  under the 1933 Act and no stop order  suspending  the  effectiveness  has been issued under the 1933  Act  or  proceedings   therefor  initiated  or,  to  counsel's  knowledge, threatened by the Commission.\n\n                  (xii) At the time the  Conversion  Application,  including the Offering Prospectus contained therein, was approved,  the Conversion Application including the Offering Prospectus contained therein (as amended or supplemented, if so amended or supplemented) complied as to form in all material respects with the  requirements  of all  applicable  federal laws and the rules,  regulations, decisions  and orders of the OTS (except as to the financial  statements,  other financial data and stock valuation information included therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion); to the best of such counsel's knowledge, based on  conferences  with  management  of and the  independent  accountants  for the Company and the Association,  and on such investigation of the corporate records of the Company and the Association as such counsel  conducted in connection with the preparation of the  Registration  Statement and the Conversion  Application, all material  documents  and exhibits  required to be filed with the  Conversion Application (as amended or  supplemented,  if so amended or  supplemented)  have been so filed.  The  description in the Conversion  Application and the Offering Prospectus  contained  therein of such documents and exhibits is accurate in all material respects and fairly presents the information required to be shown.\n\n                  (xiii)  At the time  that the  Registration  Statement  became effective,  (i) the  Registration  Statement (as amended or  supplemented  if so amended  or  supplemented)  (other  than  the  financial  statements  and  other financial and statistical data and stock valuation information included therein, as to which no opinion  need be  rendered),  complied as to form in all material respects with the  requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and (ii) the Offering  Prospectus  (other than the  financial  statements  and other financial and  statistical  data and the stock  valuation  information  included therein,  as to which no opinion  need be  rendered)  complied as to form in all material  respects  with  the  requirements  of  the  1933  Act,  the  1933  Act Regulations,  Conversion Regulations and Federal and State law (other than state blue sky law as to which we express no opinion).  To the best of such  counsel's knowledge based on the conferences and document review  specified in item (xiii) above,  all  material  documents  and  exhibits  required  to be filed  with the Registration   Statement  (as  amended  or   supplemented,   if  so  amended  or supplemented) have been so filed. The description in the Registration  Statement and the Offering  Prospectus  of such  documents and exhibits is accurate in all\n\n\n\n\n\nmaterial respects and fairly\n\n                                      -17-\n\npresents the  information  required to be shown.  To the best of such  counsel's knowledge,  no person has sought to obtain  regulatory or judicial review of the final action of the OTS approving the Conversion Application or in approving the Holding Company Application.\n\n                  (xiv) During the course of such  counsel's  representation  of the Company and the  Association,  nothing has come to such counsel's  attention that  caused it to believe  that (i) the Company  and the  Association  have not conducted the  Conversion,  in all material  respects,  in  accordance  with all applicable  requirements  of the Plan and applicable law, and (ii) the Plan, the Conversion  Application,  the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus (other than the financial  statements and other financial and  statistical  data and the stock valuation information included therein as to which no opinion need be rendered) do not comply in all material  respects with all  applicable  laws, rules,  regulations,  decisions  and orders  including,  but not limited to, the Conversion Regulations,  the HOLA, the 1933 Act and 1933 Act Regulations and all other  applicable  laws,  regulations,   decisions  and  orders,  including  all applicable  terms,  conditions,  requirements  and  provisions  precedent to the Conversion imposed upon it by the OTS, the Commission and the FDIC, if any.\n\n                  (xv) The  terms  and  provisions  of the  Common  Stock of the Company  conform  to the  description  thereof  contained  in  the  Registration Statement  and the Offering  Prospectus,  and the form of  certificates  used to evidence the Shares are in due and proper form.\n\n                  (xvi) To the best  knowledge  of such  counsel,  there  are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened which are required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus,  other than those disclosed therein,  and all pending legal and governmental  proceedings to which  the  Company  or the  Association  is a party  or of  which  any of their property is the subject  which are not described in the  Registration  Statement and the Offering Prospectus, including ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, are, considered in the aggregate, not material;  provided that for this purpose, any litigation or governmental  proceeding is not considered to be \"threatened\"  unless  the  potential  litigant  or  governmental  authority  has manifested  to the  management  of the  Company or the  Association,  or to such counsel, a present intention to initiate such litigation or proceeding.\n\n                  (xvii) To the best knowledge of such counsel,  the Company and the  Association  have  obtained all  licenses,  permits and other  governmental authorizations  required for the conduct of their respective businesses,  except where the failure to have such  licenses,  permits or  authorizations  would not have a material adverse effect on the business, operations or income or business prospects of the Company and the Association, and all such licenses, permits and other governmental  authorizations are in full force and effect, and the Company and the Association are in all material respects complying therewith.\n\n                  (xviii)   Neither  the  Company  nor  the  Association  is  in contravention of its certificate of incorporation or its charter,  respectively, or its bylaws (and the Association  will not be in  contravention of its charter or bylaws in stock form upon  consummation  of the  Conversion)  or, to the best knowledge  of such  counsel,  in  contravention  of any  obligation,  agreement, covenant or condition contained in any material contract,  indenture,  mortgage, loan  agreement,  note,  lease or other  instrument to which it is a party or by which it or its property may be bound which  contravention  would be material to the business of the Company and the  Association  considered as one  enterprise; the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the Association, the incurring of the  obligations  herein set forth and the  consummation of the transactions contemplated herein have been duly authorized by all necessary\n\n                                      -18-\n\ncorporate action of the Company and the Association,  and, to the best knowledge of such counsel,  will not constitute a material breach of, or default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any material lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or the Association which are material to their  business  considered  as one  enterprise,  pursuant  to any  contract, indenture,  mortgage,  loan agreement,  note, lease or other instrument to which the Company or the  Association is a party or by which any of them may be bound, or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or the  Association  is subject.  In addition,  such action will not result in any  contravention of the provisions of the certificate of  incorporation  or bylaws of the Company or the Association  or any  applicable  law,  act,  regulation or order or court order, writ,  injunction or decree.  The charter of the  Association  in stock form has been approved by the OTS.\n\n                  (xix) To the best  knowledge of such counsel,  the Company and the  Association  have good and  marketable  title to all  properties and assets described in the Registration  Statement as owned by them, free and clear of all liens,  charges,  encumbrances or restrictions,  except such as are described in the  Registration  Statement  or are not material in relation to the business of the Company and the Association considered as one enterprise; and to the best of such  counsel's  knowledge,  all of the leases  and  subleases  material  to the business  of the  Company  and the  Association  under which the Company and the\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociation hold properties,  as described in the Registration Statement, are in full force and effect.\n\n                  (xx) The Company and the  Association  are not in violation of any directive from the OTS or the FDIC to make any material change in the method of conducting  their business and the Company and the Association have conducted and are conducting their business so as to comply in all material  respects with all  applicable  statutes  and  regulations   (including,   without  limitation, regulations, decisions, directives and orders of the OTS and the FDIC).\n\n                  (xxi)  The  information  in  the  Registration  Statement  and Offering Prospectus under the captions  \"Regulation,\"  \"Certain  Restrictions on Acquisitions of the Company,\" \"The  Conversion,\"  \"Description of Capital Stock\" and the  information  in response to Items 7(d)(l),  7(f),  7(g) and 7(i) of the Form PS of the Conversion Regulations, to the extent that it constitutes matters of  law,  summaries  of  legal  matters,  documents  or  proceedings,  or  legal conclusions,  has been  reviewed by such  counsel and is correct in all material respects  (except  as to the  financial  statements  and  other  financial  data included therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion).\n\n                  In  rendering  such  opinion,  such counsel may rely (A) as to matters  involving the  application of laws of any  jurisdiction  other than the United  States,  to the extent such counsel  deems proper and  specified in such opinion satisfactory to Capital Resources,  upon the opinion of other counsel of good  standing  (providing  that such counsel  states that Capital  Resources is justified in relying upon such  specified  opinion or  opinions),  and (B) as to matters of fact,  to the extent such counsel deems proper,  on  certificates  of responsible  officers of the Company and the  Association  and public  officials (but not on  conclusions  of law which  may be set forth in said  certificates); provided copies of any such opinion(s) or  certificates  are delivered  pursuant hereto  or to  Capital  Resources  together  with  the  opinion  to be  rendered hereunder by special  counsel to the Company and the  Association.  Such counsel may assume that any agreement is the valid and binding obligation of any parties to such agreement other than the Company or the Association.\n\n                  (2) The  letter  of  Malizia,  Spidi,  Sloane &  Fisch,  P.C., counsel for the  Company and the  Association  addressed  to Capital  Resources, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance to the effect that:\n\n                                      -19-\n\n                  During the  preparation  of the  Conversion  Application,  the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus, such counsel participated in conferences with management of, and the independent  public  accountants for the Company  and the  Association.  Based  upon  such  conferences  and a review  of corporate  records of the Company and the Association as such counsel  conducted in connection with the preparation of the Registration  Statement and Conversion Application, nothing has come to their attention that would lead them to believe that the  Conversion  Application,  the  Registration  Statement,  the  Offering Prospectus,  or any  amendment or supplement  thereto  (other than the financial statements  and  other  financial  and  statistical  data  and  stock  valuation information  included  therein,  as to which such counsel need express no view), contained an untrue  statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.\n\n                  (3) The  favorable  opinion,  dated as of the Closing Date, of Serchuk &  Zelermyer,  LLP,  Capital  Resources'  counsel,  with respect to such matters as Capital Resources may reasonably require.  Such opinion may rely upon the opinions of counsel to the Company and the Association, and as to matters of fact,  upon  certificates  of  officers  and  directors  of the  Company and the Association  delivered  pursuant  hereto  or as such  counsel  shall  reasonably request.\n\n                  (d) At the Closing Date,  counsel to Capital  Resources  shall have been  furnished  with such  documents  and opinions as they may  reasonably require  for the  purpose  of  enabling  them to render  the  opinion  as herein contemplated  and related  proceedings or in order to evidence the occurrence or completeness of any of the representations or warranties,  or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained.\n\n                  (e) At the Closing  Date,  Capital  Resources  shall receive a certificate of the Chief Executive  Officer and the Chief  Financial  Officer of the Company and of the Chief Executive  Officer and Chief  Financial  Officer of the  Association,  dated as of such Closing Date,  to the effect that:  (i) they have carefully  examined the Offering  Prospectus and, in their opinion,  at the time the  Offering  Prospectus  became  authorized  for final use,  the Offering Prospectus  did not contain an untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omit to state a material  fact  necessary in order to make the  statements  therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under which they were made,  not  misleading;  (ii) since the date the Offering Prospectus became authorized for final use, in their opinion no event has  occurred  which should have been set forth in an amendment or  supplement  to the  Offering  Prospectus  which  has not been so set  forth, including specifically,  but without limitation,  any material adverse change in the condition,  financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, capital, properties, business  prospects or business affairs of the Company or the  Association,  and the conditions set forth in this Section 8 have been satisfied;  (iii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration  Statement and the Offering  Prospectus,  there has been no material  adverse change in the condition,  financial or  otherwise,  or in the earnings,  capital,  properties, business  affairs or  business  prospects  of the  Company  or the  Association,\n\n\n\n\n\nindependently,  or  of  the  Company  and  the  Association  considered  as  one enterprise,  whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business;  (iv) to the best  knowledge  of such  officers the  representations  and  warranties  in Section  4 are true  and  correct  with the same  force  and  effect  as  though expressly  made  at and  as of  the  Closing  Date;  (v)  the  Company  and  the Association  have complied with all material  agreements and  satisfied,  in all material  respects at or prior to the Closing Date, all obligations  required to be met by  such  date  and  will  in  all  material  respects  comply  with  all obligations  to be  satisfied  by them  after  Conversion;  (vi)  no stop  order suspending the  effectiveness of the  Registration  Statement has been initiated or, to the best  knowledge  of the  Company or  Association,  threatened  by the Commission or any state authority; (vii) no order suspending the Subscription or Public Offerings, the Conversion, the\n\n                                      -20-\n\nacquisition  of all of the  shares  of the  Association  by the  Company  or the effectiveness  of the  Offering  Prospectus  has  been  issued  and to the  best knowledge of the Company or  Association,  no proceedings  for that purpose have been initiated or threatened by the OTS, the Commission,  the FDIC, or any state authority;  and (viii) to the best of their  knowledge,  no person has sought to obtain review of the final action of the OTS approving the Plan.\n\n                  (f) Prior to and at the Closing  Date:  (i) in the  reasonable opinion of Capital  Resources,  there shall have been no material adverse change in the condition,  financial or otherwise,  or in the earnings,  or the business affairs or business  prospects of the Company or the Association  independently, or of the Company or the  Association,  considered as one enterprise,  since the latest dates as of which such condition is set forth in the Offering Prospectus, except  as  referred  to  therein;  (ii)  there  shall  have  been  no  material transaction  entered into by the Company or the Association from the latest date as of which the  financial  condition of the Company or the  Association  is set forth  in  the  Offering  Prospectus  other  than  transactions  referred  to or contemplated  therein;  (iii)  the  Company  or the  Association  shall not have received  from the OTS or the FDIC any  direction  (oral or written) to make any material change in the method of conducting their business with which it has not complied  (which  direction,  if any,  shall  have  been  disclosed  to  Capital Resources) and which would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the  business,  operations  or  financial  condition  or income of the Company or the  Association  taken as a whole;  (iv) neither the Company nor the Association  shall have been in default (nor shall an event have occurred which, with  notice or lapse of time or both,  would  constitute  a default)  under any provision of and  agreement or instrument  relating to any material  outstanding indebtedness;  (v) no action, suit or proceedings, at law or in equity or before or by any federal or state  commission,  board or other  administrative  agency, shall be  pending,  or, to the  knowledge  of the  Company  or the  Association, threatened  against the Company or the  Association  or  affecting  any of their properties wherein an unfavorable  decision,  ruling or finding would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse  effect on the business,  operations, financial  condition  or income of the  Company or the  Association,  taken as a whole;  and (vi) the Shares have been  qualified or registered  for offering and sale  under the  securities  or blue sky laws of the  jurisdictions  as  Capital Resources shall have requested and as agreed to by the Company.\n\n                  (g) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Capital Resources shall receive a letter from KPMG,  dated the date hereof and addressed to Capital  Resources:  (i) confirming that KPMG is a firm of independent public accountants  within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and 12 C.F.R. ss. 571.2(c)(3) and no information concerning its relationship with or interests in the Company and the  Association is required to be disclosed in the Offering Prospectus by the Conversion Regulations or Item 10 of the Registration Statement, and stating in effect that in KPMG's opinion the financial statements of the Association as are included in the Offering  Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1933 Act and the related published rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and the Conversion  Regulations and generally  accepted  accounting  principles; (ii) stating in effect that, on the basis of certain agreed upon procedures (but not  an  audit  examination  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing standards)  consisting of a reading of the latest  available  unaudited  interim financial statements of the Association  prepared by the Association,  a reading of the  minutes of the  meetings  of the Board of  Directors  and members of the Association and consultations  with officers of the Association  responsible for financial and accounting  matters,  nothing came to their attention which caused them to  believe  that:  (A)  such  unaudited  financial  statements  are not in conformity  with generally  accepted  accounting  principles  applied on a basis substantially  consistent with that of the audited financial statements included in the Offering Prospectus;

Any  certificates  signed by an  officer or  director  of the Company or the  Association  and  delivered to Capital  Resources or its counsel shall be deemed a representation  and warranty by the Company or the Association to Capital Resources as to the statements made therein.\n\n                  If any of the  conditions  specified in this Section shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this  Agreement,  this Agreement and all of Capital  Resources'  obligations  hereunder  may be  canceled  by Capital Resources by notifying the  Association  of such  cancellation  in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to the Closing Date, and any such  cancellation shall be without  liability  of any party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 2, 7, 9 and 10 hereof.  Notwithstanding  the above, if this\n\n\n\n\n\nAgreement  is  canceled  pursuant  to  this  paragraph,   the  Company  and  the Association  jointly and severally agree to reimburse  Capital Resources for all out-of-pocket  expenses,  (including without limitation the fees and expenses of Capital Resources' counsel) reasonably incurred by Capital Resources and Capital Resources'  counsel at its normal rates,  in connection  with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus,  and in contemplation of the proposed  Subscription  or Public  Offerings  to the extent  provided for in Sections 2 and 7 hereof.\n\n                  SECTION 9.  Indemnification.\n\n                  (a) The Company  and the  Association  jointly  and  severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless Capital Resources, its officers, directors, agents and  employees  and each person,  if any, who controls or is under common control with Capital  Resources within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act,  against any and all loss,  liability,  claim, damage or expense whatsoever (including but not limited to settlement expenses), joint or several,  that Capital  Resources or any of them may suffer or to which Capital  Resources  and any such persons  upon  written  demand for any expenses (including fees and  disbursements of counsel)  incurred by Capital Resources or any of them  in  connection  with  investigating,  preparing  or  defending  any actions,  proceedings or claims (whether  commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities  or actions (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material\n\n                                      -23-\n\nfact  contained in the  Registration  Statement  (or any amendment or supplement thereto),  preliminary  or  final  Offering  Prospectus  (or  any  amendment  or supplement thereto),  the Conversion  Application or any Blue Sky application or other  instrument  or document of the Company or the  Association  or based upon written  information  supplied  by the Company or the  Association  filed in any state or  jurisdiction  to  register  or qualify any or all of the Shares or the subscription  rights  applicable  thereto  under  the  securities  laws  thereof (collectively,  the  \"Blue  Sky  Application\"),  or  any  application  or  other document,  advertisement, oral statement, or communication (\"Sales Information\") prepared,  made or executed  by or on behalf of the Company  with its consent or based upon written or oral information  furnished by or on behalf of the Company or the Association, whether or not filed in any jurisdiction in order to qualify or register the Shares under the securities  laws thereof;  (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing documents  or  information,  a material  fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under which  they were  made,  not  misleading;  or,  (iii)  arise  from any theory of liability  whatsoever relating to or arising from or based upon the Registration Statement  (or any  amendment  or  supplement  thereto),  preliminary  or  final Offering  Prospectus  (or any amendment or supplement  thereto),  the Conversion Application,   any  Blue  Sky   Application   or  Sales   Information  or  other documentation distributed in connection with the Conversion;  provided, however, that no  indemnification is required under this paragraph (a) to the extent such losses, claims,  damages,  liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue  material  statements or alleged  untrue  material  statements in, or material omission or alleged material omission from, the Registration  Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Conversion  Application,  any Blue Sky Application,  the preliminary or final Offering Prospectus (or any amendment or  supplement  thereto),  or Sales  Information  made in  reliance  upon and in conformity with written information  furnished to the Company or the Association by Capital Resources  regarding  Capital  Resources  expressly for use under the caption \"The Conversion - Marketing Arrangements\" in the Offering Prospectus nor is  indemnification  required for material  oral  misstatements  made by Capital Resources,  which are not based upon information  provided by the Association or the  Company  orally or in  writing  or based on  information  contained  in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto),  preliminary or final  Offering  Prospectus  (or  any  amendment  or  supplement  thereto),  the Conversion   Application,   any  Blue  Sky  Application  or  Sales   Information distributed in connection with the Conversion.\n\n                  (b) Capital  Resources  agrees to indemnify  and hold harmless the Company and the Association,  their directors and officers, agents, servants and  employees  and  each  person,  if any,  who  controls  the  Company  or the Association within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act  against  any and all loss,  liability,  claim,  damage or  expense whatsoever (including but not limited to settlement expenses),  joint or several which they,  or any of them,  may suffer or to which they,  or any of them,  may become subject under all applicable federal and state laws or otherwise,  and to promptly  reimburse  the  Company,  the  Association  and any such  persons upon written demand for any expenses  (including fees and  disbursements  of counsel) incurred by them, or any of them, in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions,  proceedings or claims (whether  commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages,  liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact  contained in the  Registration  Statement  (or any amendment of supplement thereto),  or the preliminary or final Offering  Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto),  or the Conversion  Application or any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing  documents a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein,  in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,  not  misleading;  provided,  however,  that Capital Resources  obligations  under this  Section 9(b) shall exist only if and only to the\n\n                                      -24-\n\n\n\n\n\nextent that such untrue  statement or alleged  untrue  statement was made in, or such material fact or alleged  material fact was omitted from, the  Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement  thereto),  the  preliminary  or final Offering Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto),  or the Conversion Application,  any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information in reliance upon and in  conformity  with  written  information  furnished  to  the  Company  or  the Association by Capital Resources  regarding Capital Resources  expressly for use under the caption  \"The  Conversion  - Marketing  Arrangements\"  in the Offering Prospectus  or in the event of oral  misstatements  made by  Capital  Resources, which are not based upon information  provided by the Association or the Company orally or in  writing  or based on  information  contained  in the  Registration Statement  (or any  amendment  or  supplement  thereto),  preliminary  or  final Offering  Prospectus  (or any amendment or supplement  thereto),  the Conversion Application,  any  Blue Sky  Application  or Sales  Information  distributed  in connection with the Conversion.\n\n                  (c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt written notice to each indemnifying party of any action,  proceeding,  claim (whether commenced or threatened),  or suit instituted against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought  hereunder,  but  failure to so notify an  indemnifying  party  shall not relieve it from any liability  which it may have on account of this Section 9 or otherwise.  An  indemnifying  party may  participate  at its own  expense in the defense of such action.  In addition,  if it so elects within a reasonable  time after  receipt of such notice,  an  indemnifying  party,  jointly with any other indemnifying  parties  receiving such notice,  may assume defense of such action with  counsel  chosen by it and  approved by the  indemnified  parties  that are defendants in such action,  unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those  available to such  indemnifying party.  If an  indemnifying  party  assumes  the  defense  of such  action,  the indemnifying  parties  shall not be liable for any fees and  expenses of counsel for the indemnified  parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action, proceeding or claim,  other than reasonable costs of investigation.  In no event shall the indemnifying  parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one  separate  firm of  attorneys  (and any special  counsel  that said firm may retain)  for  all  indemnified  parties  in  connection  with  any  one  action, proceeding or claim or separate but similar or related  actions,  proceedings or claims in the same jurisdiction  arising out of the same general  allegations or circumstances.\n\n                  (d) The agreements  contained in this Section 9 and in Section 10  hereof  and  the  representations  and  warranties  of the  Company  and the Association set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of: (i) any investigation  made by or on behalf of Capital Resources or its officers, directors or controlling persons, agents or employees or by or on behalf of the Company or the Association or any officers,  directors or controlling persons, agents or employees of the Company or the Association or any controlling  person,  director or officer of the Company or the Association; (ii) delivery of and payment  hereunder for the Shares; or (iii) any termination of this Agreement.\n\n                  (e) No  indemnification  by the Association under Section 9(a) hereof nor  contribution  under Section 10 hereof shall be effective if the same shall be deemed to be in violation of any law, rule or regulation  applicable to the  Association  including,  without  limitation,  Section  23A of the  Federal Reserve Act. If the  indemnification  or  contribution by the Association is not effective  pursuant  to the  preceding  sentence,  then the  indemnification  by Capital  Resources  pursuant to Section 9(b) shall be given only to the Company, its  directors  and  officers,  agents,  servants and  employees  and not to the Association,  its directors and officers, agents, servants and employees and the Association  shall not be entitled to any  contribution  from Capital  Resources pursuant to Section 10.\n\n                                      -25-\n\n                  SECTION  10.  Contribution.  In order to provide  for just and equitable  contribution in circumstances in which the  indemnification  provided for in  Section 9 is due in  accordance  with its  terms  but is for any  reason unavailable  as a result of  Section  9(e) or held by a court to be  unavailable from the  Company,  the  Association  or Capital  Resources,  the  Company,  the Association  and Capital  Resources  shall  contribute to the aggregate  losses, claims,  damages and liabilities  (including any investigation,  legal and other expenses  incurred in connection  with, and any amount paid in settlement of any action,  suit or  proceeding  of any claims  asserted,  but after  deducting any contribution  received by the Company or the  Association  or Capital  Resources from  persons  other than the other  party  thereto,  who may also be liable for contribution)  in such  proportion so that Capital  Resources is responsible for that  portion  represented  by the  percentage  that  the fees  paid to  Capital Resources pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the Shares in the Subscription and Public  Offerings and the Company and the Association  shall be responsible for the balance.  If, however,  the allocation provided above is not permitted  by  applicable  law or if the  indemnified  party  failed to give the notice  required  under  Section 9 above,  then each  indemnifying  party  shall contribute  to such  amount  paid or payable by such  indemnified  party in such proportion  as is  appropriate  to reflect not only such  relative  fault of the Company and the  Association on the one hand and Capital  Resources on the other\n\n\n\n\n\nin connection  with the  statements or omissions  which resulted in such losses, claims,  damages or  liabilities  (or actions,  proceedings or claims in respect thereof), but also the relative benefits received by the Company and Association on the one hand and Capital  Resources on the other from the offering as well as any other relevant equitable  considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the  Association  on the one hand and Capital  Resources  on the other shall be deemed to be in the same  proportion as the total gross  proceeds from the Subscription and Public Offerings (before deducting  expenses) received by the  Company  bear to the total fees (not  including  expenses)  received  by Capital Resources. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things,  whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the  omission  or  alleged  omission  to state a  material  fact  relates  to information  supplied by the Company  and/or the  Association on the one hand or Capital  Resources on the other and the parties'  relative  intent,  good faith, knowledge,  access to  information  and  opportunity  to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company, the Association and Capital Resources agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were  determined by pro rata  allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified  party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action,  proceedings or claims in  respect  thereof)  referred  to above in this  Section 10 shall be deemed to include any legal or other  expenses  reasonably  incurred  by such  indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action,  proceeding or claim. It is expressly agreed that Capital  Resources shall not be liable for any loss,  liability,  claim, damage or expense or be required to contribute any amount which in the aggregate  exceeds the amount paid  (excluding  reimbursable expenses) to Capital  Resources under this Agreement.  It is understood that the above-stated  limitation on Capital Resources' liability is essential to Capital Resources and that Capital  Resources  relied upon such limitation and would not have entered into this  Agreement if such  limitation  had not been agreed to by the  parties  to this  Agreement.  No  person  found  guilty  of any  fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled  to  contribution  from any  person  who was not  found  guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Company and the Association under this Section 10 and under  Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the  Association  may otherwise have. For purposes of this Section 10,  each of Capital  Resources',  the  Company's  or the  Association's officers and directors and each person,  if any, who controls Capital  Resources or the  Company or the  Association  within the  meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act shall  have the same  rights to  contribution  as the  Company  and the Association.\n\n                                      -26-\n\nAny  party  entitled  to  contribution,  promptly  after  receipt  of  notice of commencement  of any action,  suit,  claim or  proceeding  against such party in respect of which a claim for  contribution  may be made  against  another  party under this  Section 10, will  notify  such party from whom  contribution  may be sought,  but the  omission  to so notify  such party shall not relieve the party from whom  contribution  may be sought  from any  other  obligation  it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section 10.\n\n                  SECTION  11.  Survival  of  Agreements,   Representations  and Indemnities.  The respective  indemnities of the Company,  the  Association  and Capital Resources and the representations and warranties and other statements of the Company and the  Association set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall  remain  in full  force  and  effect,  regardless  of any  termination  or cancellation  of this  Agreement  or any  investigation  made by or on behalf of Capital  Resources,  the Company,  the  Association  or any  indemnified  person referred to in Section 9 hereof,  and shall  survive the issuance of the Shares, and any legal  representative,  successor  or assign of Capital  Resources,  the Association, and any such indemnified person shall be entitled to the benefit of the respective agreements, indemnities, warranties and representations.\n\n                  SECTION 12.  Termination.  Capital Resources may terminate  this Agreement by giving the notice indicated below in this Section at any time after this Agreement becomes effective as follows:\n\n                  (a) In the event the  Company  fails to sell all of the Shares within the period  specified,  and in accordance with the provisions of the Plan or as required by the Conversion  Regulations and applicable law, this Agreement shall terminate upon refund by the Association to each person who has subscribed for or ordered any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from such person, together with interest as provided in the Offering Prospectus,  and no party to this  Agreement  shall have any  obligation to the other  hereunder, except  for  payment  by the  Association  and/or  the  Company  as set forth in Sections 2, 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n                  (b) If any of the conditions  specified in Section 8 shall not have been  fulfilled when and as required by this  Agreement,  or by the Closing Date,  or waived in writing  by Capital  Resources,  this  Agreement  and all of Capital Resources  obligations hereunder may be canceled by Capital Resources by notifying the Association of such  cancellation in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to the  Closing  Date,  and,  any  such  cancellation  shall be without  Liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise  provided in Sections 2, 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n                  (c) If Capital Resources elects to terminate this Agreement as provided in this section,  the Company and the Association  shall be notified as provided in Section 13 hereof,  promptly by Capital  Resources  by  telephone or telegram, confirmed by letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n               SECTION  13.
